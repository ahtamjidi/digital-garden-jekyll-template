**3. What are the big questions this book aims to answer?**

I’d say there are three, and they are interrelated. First, how can we explain the psychological diversity that has now been documented around the world? Second, why are the WEIRD populations, who so dominate what we know scientifically about “human” decision-making, motivation and reasoning, psychologically different? And finally, does the shifting psychology of Europeans over the last millennium help us understand the massive military and commercial expansions of these populations around the globe after 1500 and the economic eruption, known as the industrial revolution, after 1750 CE?
