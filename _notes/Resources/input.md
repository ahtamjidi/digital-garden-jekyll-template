    A very good paper I came across this morning by the DeepMind researchers. For the past five years Transformers have been one of the most dominant approaches to Deep Learning problems, especially in the #NLP domain. However, despite many interesting papers on the topic, and lots of good open code, there has been a noticeable lack of *formal* definition of what transformed are, especially on the level of pseudocode. This paper aims to rectify that. It provides pseudocode for almost all major Transformer architectures, including training algorithms. One of the main benefits of having this pseudocode available is for the researchers who want to expand and modify some aspects of the transformer architecture, and go beyond any particular framework or even ML paradigm.

    ✨ Who wants an 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿 for 𝗮𝗿𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀? Last Wednesday researchers from University of Lisbon and DeepMind released a paper where they proposed an infinite-memory transformer or ∞-𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢𝙚𝙧. The model is able to model arbitrarily long contexts. 🔹 ∞-𝙛𝙤𝙧𝙢𝙚𝙧 (infinite-former) is a transformer model extended with an unbounded long-term memory (LTM). It is able to attend to arbitrarily long contexts. 🔹 The main idea behind the ∞-former is 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗻𝘂𝗼𝘂𝘀 attention, where the attention 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝘀𝘀 function over words is 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗱 by 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 over a (continuous) signal. 🔹 The continuous signal is obtained by representing the text as a linear combination of 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (yes, it's the same trick you might know from good old SVMs!) 🔹 Ok, but what's the 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆? Well, it depends only on the number of basis functions, but not on the length of the sequence! 🔹 You might think - well, what if there are certain parts of the text (signal) that are more relevant to the task at hand? To address this, the authors propose 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗸𝘆 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 - a histogram-based mechanism that allows the model to use more memory to represent more important parts of the (encoded) input. 💎 🔹 Infinite-former 𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘀 Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer on a long-range 𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 task (4k, 8k, 16k tokens). It also beats 𝗯𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀 in language modeling tasks in terms of 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆. _____________ 💡 Paper: https://lnkd.in/e8aqzShx 💡 Authors: Pedro Henrique Martins, Zita Marinho, André F. T.

    Context switches can be costly to recover from. In this post, I'll share a few tips from Elaine Meyer on reducing the cost of context switches, which can improve productivity and reduce frustration. When we context switch, our brains receive multiple stimuli at once. This leads to a kind of “response selection bottleneck” that slows thought and decision-making. Upon returning to a task after a distraction, it can take up to 23 minutes to re-focus. How can you manage to get back in that flow state just a little quicker? For example, you can break up your mental model of your larger tasks into smaller ones. If you’re in the middle of something so complex you would forget if you had to step away for a few minutes or are interrupted, persist that state somewhere outside of your brain - write it down somewhere!. I highly recommend reading "The productivity tax you pay for context switching" by Elaine (https://lnkd.in/gVJSW8c6) which includes some concrete suggestions for reducing the cost of context switches: 1. Promote thoughtful, asynchronous communication Do your part to minimize the context switching others have to do. Change your workplace’s “always on” culture by encouraging asynchronous communication. Make it clear team members aren’t expected to give an immediate, real-time response to emails or team chats. 2. Capture tasks somewhere that’s not your head Just thinking about another task splits our attention and makes it harder to focus on what’s in front of us in the moment. Studies show that simply making a plan to complete a task later helps to reduce repetitive thoughts about the task. 3. Have a go-to framework for prioritizing tasks Focusing on one thing at a time starts with deciding what that thing will be. However, when your priorities aren’t clear, deciding what to do can become its own distraction. Distinguish between high-value, non-urgent tasks and low-value, urgent ones with the Eisenhower decision matrix. Get realistic about what you actually have time for. 4. Batch your tasks and block your time Once you know what you’ll focus on, you’ll need a daily structure for staying focused on it. Task batching, time blocking, time-boxing and pomodoros are all useful tools at your disposal. What are they? - Task batching: Grouping and performing similar tasks together - Time blocking: Dividing your day into blocks, such as “meetings,” “email,” and “deep work”. - Time boxing: Setting a limit on how much time you spend on a task 5. Proactively eliminate as many distractions as possible Even if you think you’re going to read just one email, it’s hard not to get sucked deeper into your inbox once you’ve opened it. Try to focus on one task, screen, app, and window at a time, and eliminate what causes you to switch contexts in the first place — the buzzes and screen notifications and excess tabs in your web browser. #softwareengineering #productivity[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6961038258197716992?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6961038258197716992%29)

    One of the coolest things I've learned about in the last few years is streaming technology. It's becoming increasingly important for online feature computation, real-time observability, and continual learning. Like many people coming from a machine learning background that I've talked to, I used to dread streaming. This post is (hopefully) a not-too-scary introduction to streaming for data scientists. I'm still learning about streaming -- feedback is appreciated! https://lnkd.in/g3r-_ER2 #realtimeml #mlops #streamingdata #mlengineer #monitoring #machinelearning #datascientists[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6961114650507698176?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6961114650507698176%29)

    My comparison of GPT-3 and BLOOM Large Language Models, against various Science and Health topics. My notebook is attached, feel free to tune accordingly and generate your own comparisons. Many reasons to be excited about BLOOM, the new open source, 176billion parameter, multilingual LLM. That it trained for months on a nuclear powered supercomputer, with many terabytes of memory and +3k GPUs. That excess heat from the process was used to warm dorm rooms. That English makes up less than 1/3 of its unprecedented training set, and is broadly comprised of diverse other sources such as Chinese, Niger-Congo and coding examples. But my selling point is Cash Money, BLOOM is easily saving me hundreds of dollars per generative content, knowledge graph project. Checkout my introductory example, I don't think there is a more easy to use reference out there, but I'm biased.

    📢 New & improved material to dive into geometric deep learning! 💠🕸️ For a second year in a row, Michael Bronstein (Oxford / Twitter), Joan Bruna (NYU), Taco Cohen (Qualcomm) and I have delivered our Master's course on Geometric DL for the African Master's in Machine Intelligence. We make all materials publicly available! https://lnkd.in/eehB8cYz Read on for key gems 💎 and dragons 🐉... What to expect in the 2022 iteration? We made careful modifications to our content, making it more streamlined and (hopefully) more accessible! Featuring: * A revamped introductory lecture * Clearer discussion of Transformers * A new lecture going beyond groups, into the realm of category theory! 🐲 Beyond this, we offer a completely revamped set of exciting guest seminars, with Francesco Di Giovanni, Fabrizio Frasca, Geordie Williamson, Cristian Bodnar and Russ Bates exploring various advanced topics and perspectives for future work! Further, if you would like to sharpen your coding skills in GDL, we also feature fantastic Colab tutorials from Cristian Bodnar, Iulia Duta, Paul Scherer, Gabriele Cesa, Charlie Harris, Chaitanya Joshi and Ramon Viñas! Last but not least: wide thank-you to everyone at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) for offering us the honour of delivering this course to #Africa🌍's brightest Master students. Thank you so much Moustapha Cisse, Teta Bahunde, Kobby Panford-Quainoo, and the other great course TAs! Your support was greatly appreciated. Just like last year, we very much hope you will enjoy our materials, which we made freely accessible to everyone, free of charge! 😊 And of course, we welcome any and all feedback, especially as we work towards finalising our full book for publication with The MIT Press in 2023! 📖[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6958053592117166080?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6958053592117166080%29)

    Stretch your brain - I would add that to this list. Stretch / Challenge your brain: - Create new neural paths: Neuroplasticity is real, you can create new neural paths by as easy as using your non-dominant hand. BDNF plays a huge role in this (read about it). Don’t just read / learn; apply yourself, solve problems under competing constraints, solve puzzles, build something tangible. Travel to remote places. As Bryan Cranston puts it, get lost and find yourself back. Your creativity goes through the roof. - Create new neurons: Neurogeneis is real, aerobic and endurance workouts in moderation and antioxidant rich foods can reduce stress, remove free radicals and build new brain cells. Your memory, learning velocity, ability to get into flow mode (Mihalay) on demand increases. I have tried few of them, you can see visible changes in you.

    🗣 Speech AI: one of the most powerful AI domains 👉🏼 TLDR; http://speech.aman.ai - Speech is probably the most underrated modality in AI, yet one of the most powerful. Given that a significant part of day-to-day human communication involves speech, speech tends to be more ubiquitous compared to vision and text in most scenarios. - Virtual assistants such as #alexa are at the frontier of Speech AI, and perform a multitude of tasks to make life easier and more organized. - Furthermore, virtual assistants unlock a tremendous amount of hands-free applications, for e.g., enabling lookup of facts on the web without lifting a finger, to being able to buy items by just talking to your virtual assistant. 🧠 I’ve put together a Speech AI primer here: http://speech.aman.ai - This primer covers: 🔹 Terminology (Phones, Phonemes, Allophones, Graphemes) 🔹 Feature representation (Oscillogram, Spectrogram, MFCCs, log-Mel Spectrogram) 🔹 Speech processing tasks (Keyword Spotting, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Recognition, Code Switching) 🔹 Data augmentation (Gain, RIR, Babble noise) 🔹 Evaluation metrics (FAR, FRR, DET Curves, EER, ROC vs. DET Curves) 🔹 List of suggested videos to build a background in speech AI 👉🏼 If you enjoyed my Speech AI primer and have a penchant for the domain, my team at Amazon Alexa AI is hiring exceptional and passionate scientists.

    Information Gain (IG) is defined as a measure of how much information a feature provides about a class. IG helps to determine the order of attributes in the nodes of a decision tree. The main node is referred to as the parent node, whereas sub-nodes are known as child nodes. IG is the amount of information gained about a random variable from observing another random variable. Entropy is the average rate at which information is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable. In Data Science and Machine Learning, IG is calculated for a split by subtracting the weighted entropies of each branch from the original entropy. When training a Decision Tree using these metrics, the best split is chosen by maximizing IG. The variable that has the largest IG is selected to split the dataset. Generally, a larger gain indicates a smaller entropy or less surprise. Entropy, as it relates to Machine Learning, is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw conclusions from that information. The lower the entropy in Machine Learning, the more accurate the prediction we can make. Due to the entropy measurement, we can decide which variables are the most efficient to split on, making a decision tree more effective and accurate.

    Padé approximations provide a way to represent time delay as a rational transfer function. This is helpful if your system has delay but you still want to use control techniques like root locus, LQR, or H infinity. Check out this video to find out what they are and why they are great! https://lnkd.in/gfQ7vaJz Thanks to Arkadiy Turveskiy, Craig Buhr, Alec Stothert, and Siddharth Jawahar for their help in crafting this story and correcting the errors! #matlab #controltheory #controlsystems[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6953744295476551681?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6953744295476551681%29)

    𝐀𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 by Shagun Sodhani et al from #fair 🎯 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐋𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐦 is the branch of AI that focuses on developing lifelong learning systems - systems that keep accumulating new knowledge throughout their lifetime without forgetting the prior knowledge and use this accumulated knowledge to improve their performance on the different tasks. 🎯 We highlight that the lifelong learning paradigm is not unique to the multi-task setup and applies to the single-task setup as well. Lifelong learning is a general setup since it makes fewer assumptions about the task (or tasks). 🎯 Consider a standard single-task supervised learning setup where the learner can access the entire dataset before starting the training. In this case, the learner can perform multiple epochs over the dataset, shuffling the data in each epoch to keep the data distribution, i.i.d (independent and identically distributed). 🎯 However, there are many implicit assumptions in this setup - since we have access to the dataset beforehand, we know how many unique classes exist in the dataset. We also have access to the class distribution and can weigh the classes differently. We can also over/under-sample the data. 🎯 While these assumptions make the setup amenable for training, they also take the setup away from the more general open-ended learning setup. 🎯 If we were not to assume access to the dataset (or even the number of unique classes), the AI system would have to address challenges like modifying the network architecture as it sees new classes, not forgetting the old data points as it trains on new data points and potentially increasing the capacity of the system as new data keeps coming in. 🎯 All these challenges are studied under the paradigm of lifelong learning.

    Accelerate your NN training and converge faster: BatchNorm (BN) and LayerNorm (LN) Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy’s 2015 paper, "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" introduced the idea of BN Internal Covariate Shift is a fancy name for the **change in the distribution of network activations** due to the change in network parameters during training across layers. (See the figure, how activations create the shift and how BN fixes it) 👉 What does it mean in practice? Some classical algorithms and NNs expect normalized data i.e a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The authors showed not only ensure data is normalized before entering training but ensure it stays normalized while it’s training across layers for each mini-batch. Hence preventing the distribution changes. 👉 The above paper showed that fixing Internal Covariate shift with BN can: - Substantially decrease training time - Remove / Combine with drop-out - Decrease the quantum of regularization - Allow for increased learning rate Paper: https://lnkd.in/e2sj_EvK Next up we will examine Layer Norm Image source: https://lnkd.in/eEp9tBMA[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6950300588039401472?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6950300588039401472%29)

    If you think large companies with a massive userbase (Amazon, Google) have an easy time detecting tiny changes in A/B tests, you’re wrong! The number of users needed to detect a change grows quadratically in the sensitivity, so very large companies cannot detect changes that would lose them $10M/year. Let’s take a realistic example. You’re an e-commerce site selling widgets and 5% of users who visit during the experiment period end up purchasing. Those purchasing spend about $25. The average user therefore spends $1.25 (95% spend $0). Assume the standard deviation is $3. If you are running an A/B test and want to detect a 5% change to revenue, you plug this into the power formula: n=16 sigma^2/delta^2 as 16*3^2/(1.25*0.05)^2=36,864 users. Reasonable for a small company. Now you’re Amazon retail, or Google search with more than $100B in annual revenue. Your CFO says that s/he thinks $10M is material enough to know if you’re gaining or losing that much in your experiments (which may be optimizing for something else altogether, so this is a guardrail metric). Your delta is now 10M/100B = 0.01%. Because it’s squared in the denominator, you’re in trouble. 16*3^2/(1.25*0.0001)^2 > 9.2B users in each variant, a problem when the earth’s population is under 8B. The largest companies cannot power experiments with enough users to detect a $10M loss. QED.

    Comment: Good overview with extensive references Title: Natural and Artificial Intelligence: A brief introduction to the interplay between AI and neuroscience research See… https://lnkd.in/ecASyj9P Abstract: Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) share a long history of collaboration. Advances in neuroscience, alongside huge leaps in computer processing power over the last few decades, have given rise to a new generation of in silico neural networks inspired by the architecture of the brain. These AI systems are now capable of many of the advanced perceptual and cognitive abilities of biological systems, including object recognition and decision making. Moreover, AI is now increasingly being employed as a tool for neuroscience research and is transforming our understanding of brain functions. In particular, deep learning has been used to model how convolutional layers and recurrent connections in the brain’s cerebral cortex control important functions, including visual processing, memory, and motor control. Excitingly, the use of neuroscience-inspired AI also holds great promise for understanding how changes in brain networks result in psychopathologies, and could even be utilized in treatment regimes. Here we discuss recent advancements in four areas in which the relationship between neuroscience and AI has led to major advancements in the field; (1) AI models of working memory, (2) AI visual processing, (3) AI analysis of big neuroscience datasets, and (4) computational psychiatry.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6947862891882545152?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6947862891882545152%29)

    Canadian HR/PEO/employment help for US companies + helping people on OPT/H-1B find tech jobs in Canada
    
    1mo •
    
    I came across a LinkedIn post today from a brilliant engineer who’s lived in the US since 2016, had both a BS and MS of engineering from Georgia Tech, and failed to win the H-1B lottery… and now he’s leaving the US for good. This situation is a shame for the US. But of course it’s nothing new. I spent 20+ years in Silicon Valley helping build startups, and lived in Canada for 5 years (had a student visa and work visas), and unfortunately I have seen this happen countless times. Our system is unfair. If you ask me, I think every STEM immigrant should get a Green Card stapled to their university diploma. But of course that’s not how US immigration has worked for decades. And I don't see this changing any time soon. That’s why in 2019 I launched Path to Canada (www.path2canada.ca). The idea was to create a marketplace to connect experienced immigrant tech workers (OPT, H-1B in the US, and those who had to leave the US due to work visa issues) with Canadian companies who interview them, sponsor their Canadian work visa (using Global Talent Stream) and move them to Canada permanently. The process takes 60-90 days from start to finish and at no cost to the worker either. It’s Saturday today, and I wasn’t planning to post anything here on LinkedIn, but when I read stories about US-educated and experienced tech professionals getting kicked out of the country because of our immigration policies, it gets me going and, every time, reminds me why I do what I do. #immigration #siliconvalley #itjobs #softwareengineer[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6946480569648107520?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6946480569648107520%29)

    Many of the our common neural network architectures (CNNs, LSTMs, transformers etc.) can be described as special cases under a more generic framework known as geometric deep learning. The main idea is that each of these neural networks types impose some invariance or equivariance under some certain set of transformations of the data. For example the convolutional layers are equivariant to translations, i.e. translating (shifting) the input also translates the output by the same amount. Transformers on the other hand are permutation equivariant, so permuting the input sequence will also permute the output sequence in the same way. Thus the architectures you choose defines a prior or "inductive bias" which constrains what we can or needs to be learned. Those interested to learn more about Geometric Deep Learning can check out this excellent blog post:[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6946121023930961920?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6946121023930961920%29)

    The mystery of the ever-growing number of activation functions: Is there a secret to picking the right one? ReLU was the prominent one for a long time in spite of its shortcomings, 10s if not 100s of alternatives were proposed. Nothing could take over. #Google 🧠 released their “Searching for activation functions” paper in 2017 and claimed they exhaustively searched and figured out a simple variant or sigmoid called Swish it is the King now. Apparently, numbers claimed Swish smoked ReLU and cousins in vision tasks. But #OpenAI GPT2 paper showed they used an activation similar to Swish but a lot faster called GELU. Here is a common pattern, then on: Many NLP papers used GELU and Vision tasks used Swish (or some later variants). In the same spirit recently ReLU6 gained the spotlight. So what’s the secret? Anecdotal evidence from practitioners suggests that ReLU still is the “acceptable” choice for discriminatory tasks and it's dying neurons problem serendipitously moonlights as a dropout. You need to worry about sophisticated activation functions only when you are dealing with Pretraining or dealing with generative tasks. Just reporting what I have gathered speaking to folks, not a prescription. If something else works for you go with it by all means.

    This seemingly innocuous little thing can break your ML projects. Grab a coffee, Look at figure A and allow me to un-complicate one sliver of this huge complication. 👉Model Calibration, Confidence, and Reliability: Don’t let the idea of passing raw logits into a softmax (or a sigmoid) function (giving a multinomial distribution) trick you into thinking we get probability scores. They are not and they certainly don’t reflect the confidence as-is. If done right the probability gives you some kind of confidence in the prediction and improves reliability. The problem of predicting “probability estimates” representative of the true correctness likelihood -- is important for discriminative models in many applications. This problem plagues most models not just NNs but some more than others. Modern NNs are poorly calibrated but even classic models from sci-kit learn has this problem and they speak about it in detail (second link in the reference section), in fact, they have a dedicated class “ CalibratedClassifierCV” if this is important to you. Surprisingly most popular libraries have not integrated this as a 1st class feature into their library and left this to the MLEs to handle. 👉Mathematically speaking: Model calibration is the process by which model parameters are adjusted to ’best’ describe/fit known observations. For a given model M, Y = M(X;θ), where θ represents the model parameters. 👉My experience In 2019 a project needed heavy reliance on the model confidence, so we attempted calibrating the scores. I can’t go into details, but it is NOT hard for you to imagine a real-world use case that cannot tolerate even a 5% gap between the uncalibrated model confidence and actual confidence. It's a simple 2-step process. * Diagnose - Reliability diagrams - Flavour 1 - Calibration curves (also known as reliability diagrams) - Flavour 2 * Calibrate (Surprisingly simple post-processing calibration methods) - Temperature scaling, - Histogram binning, - Isotonic regression - Beta Calibration A: Shows the reality of building models, taking them to prod, monitoring it, and pulling the plug if needed. Our focus is on RED (Model calibration) B: Shows the gap between confidence and accuracy of the popular Resnet-152 on ImageNet, before and after various calibrations. As you can see temperature scaling closes the gap best in this example. C: Calibration Plots of Classic models 👉Python Implementation: https://lnkd.in/eQDqvbQp 👉References: - Heavy lifting is done - https://lnkd.in/eXZbrNnW - Sklearn supports calibration, they claim predict_proba methods handle it. - Sci-kit learn probability calibration - https://lnkd.in/exEyery5[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6946017446516424704?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6946017446516424704%29)

    How to deal with missing data in 2022? 1. 'text book' solutions. It's usually 'deleting data' or 'imputing data'. Which one should you choose? There is no standard answer, but it's important to analyze the distribution of data to answer some questions: Before you delete rows/columns with missing data: It's key to understand why the data is missing. • Are those data missing randomly? Are there any pattern? Maybe the missing roles or columns are correlated to another factor, and blindly removing them might bias your data. Or maybe the missing values belong to a different category. • Do you have enough data to train? If not, maybe you can't afford to delete rows with missing data. Before you impute data: • do you know the distribution the data? If you don't, maybe you should use simple method like median/mean, or averaging values of the k nearest neighbors, instead of using a complex function. Because the imputation method might introduce unknown variance to the data and it might deviate from the truth. 2. Use gradient boosting trees. XGBoost and other gradient boosting trees generally handles missing data well. It uses a 'sparsity-aware split finding' algorithm to learn how to best split the missing value in the tree. This is one of the reason data scientists use XGBoost to train their model when they have missing data or the data is sparse. I have used XGBoost for a project for the exact reason, and it worked better than other models. 3. Encode missing value as a new feature. You can add a binary column where you say this was a missing value and this wasn't, and you can you feed the data to an XGBoost model. XGBoost already knows how to deal with missing data, but if you have an indicator, it can actually learn better. This is called "missing value as a feature". It's recommended by Jesper Dramsch, PhD, scientist of machine learning. *I interviewed Jesper on 'the data scientist show' and we talked more about how to deal with missing data, Kaggle expert tips.

    We have remotely deployed Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC) onto a laboratory device equipped with a Raspberry Pi microcontroller that we have never seen in real. Sim2Real setup: Step 1, We obtained time series dataset of the device input-output dynamics from our colleagues in Europe. Step 2, We perfomed nonlinear system identificaiton with neural state space models. Step 3, We formulate parametric constrained optimal control problem. Step 4, We solve the problem offline with DPC policy optimization obtaining neural control policies. Step 5, We ship the trained policies back to our colleagues in Europe who deploy them on a real device. This work represents an important milestone that serves as a proof of concept that DPC is suitable to be used in control as a service setting. In the laboratory settings, we compared the control performance, computational requirements, and memory footprint of DPC with explicit model predictive control (MPC). We found out that DPC was able to learn policies competitive to MPC while significantly reducing computational and memory demands compared to explicit MPC. title: Differentiable predictive control: Deep learning alternative to explicit model predictive control for unknown nonlinear systems full paper: https://lnkd.in/gcmPfHUz implemented using Neuromancer toolbox: https://lnkd.in/gqbVs2uY Huge thanks to all co-authors: Karol Kiš Martin Klauco Aaron Tuor Draguna Vrabie #deeplearning #sim2real #controlsystems[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6945013362703437825?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6945013362703437825%29)

    What is the first rule in Google's Rules of Machine Learning? 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞 #1: 𝐃𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠. The 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 compilation by Google is a set of best practices that serve as a valuable guide for building machine learning solutions. While machine learning is all the rage these days, it does not mean it is always the answer. Always consider solutions based on simple heuristics to see if they can already solve your problem. For example, instead of building an NLP-based email spam detector, you can start by simply filtering out senders who have sent spam before.

    Pro-Tips to amass *respectable* technical readership on Linkedin. If building readership is a multivariate equation then all the below tips are variables of different weights (or say multipliers). Some may give you 2x and some may give 10x. 👉 1: Have a public proof of wide impact: Now, what does it look like in practice? Let's call it X, X = The delta, Δ(Your contribution , Status Quo) * the number of people whom it might help. If X is high, people would like to follow you for your unique, needle-moving work. This is what Gramformer, Styleformer & Parrot Paraphraser did to me. Btw Parrot is the number #1 paraphrase gen library in HF as of today with 200K+ downloads, https://lnkd.in/eH8F6ruZ 👉 2: Increase your luck surface area: Make your name synonymous with something. Winning a single ML competition can get your name out farther than 10 blog posts can ever could. Why ? it is a rare event. That's what WhatTheFood (WTF) did to me. The WTF app by itself created a lot of excitement, winning the 1st prize of 1000 $ was a cherry on top. 👉3: Use Nifty Visuals to convey complex ideas: Why? Visuals have at least 2 orders of magnitude lesser cognitive load compared to text. I liberally use memes & hand-drawn visuals to convey ideas. This is what my original "Transformers are a unicorn" and the "Jealous Cross entropy loss looks at Contrastive loss" memes did to me. My nifty visuals on F0.5, SVM kernel trick, Cross-attention & Gradient Checkpointing did to me. They garnered huge engagement and put me on the map. 👉 4: Show depth in your content. Don't get me wrong! Content about useful libraries is a great way to start but there is a subtle difference between a pure content broking and a content creation. I do content broking too, but that's a small portion of what I share. if you draw a spider chart of my content types, Organic, deep, and niche content will pull through 80-85% of it. My primer on topic models, the multi-part series on vector search engines, and mental models on multimodal modeling are great examples that garnered maximum engagement. 👉 5: Instead of asking people to follow you, let your content give them a compelling reason to follow you: I learned this from Bill Maher (Standup comic and Political satirist, now on HBO). When all the late-night TV hosts in the US were forced to make shorts to say "Like & Subscribe" to their digital content on YouTube, Maher refused. All great creators I know of unconsciously does this. Ask yourself "have I given enough reasons for people to follow me". I mean "+ Follow" button is right there, if they like it they will follow you, relax :-) 👉 6: Having the blessings of super-spreaders & influencers of your niche in your network helps if they engage. This is what people like Philip Vollet & Vetrivel PS did to me. 👉 7: Keep it real like Vyom Bhatia, Speak your mind & don't let anyone mess with you. Finally, thanks for all the love, warmth & support.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6944135183402995712?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6944135183402995712%29)

    CorEx Topic, A new name in topic modeling based on CorEx & seems closer to BERTTopic. New to Topic Models? Here, an Intentionally short primer. Repo in comments 👇 👉 Case A: Discover topics in a corpus with long-form docs of size: small to medium & you are open to dealing with cleanup (stop words), muck with hyper-parameters & involve HITL to assign readable topics. - Use cases: Analyse employee emails (long-form) to understand the top N topics that lead to mass resignations. - 2 Options: Matrix factorisation (MF)-based & Probabilistic sampling-based. - Mode: Unsupervised A variant of MF: Decompose a term-doc frequency matrix A into W & H (in W, all rows (i) are docs & cols (j) are words, in H, all rows are words & cols are topics). Imagine Wij. Hjk. K is the number of topics & it is manually chosen. Idea is to reduce i.e ||A-W.H||. If SVD is used for MF then it’s LSA. The probabilistic variation of it is pLSA. Another variation of pLSA is NMF. But if you do this probabilistically using sampling tech like Gibbs sampling then it’s LDA. - Pros: The topics are open for good human interpretations. - Cons: By default, the word is the tactical unit, and word order & context are ignored (Though you could play with the ngram range while generating a term-doc matrix, it’s still a BoW). You are also at the mercy of the implementation, I have “heard” Mallet is “decent”. Finally, Can’t handle a huge corpus. 👉 Case B: Discover topics in a corpus of long or short texts & you don’t want to deal with corpus cleanup, a lot of hyper-parameters, leveraging SoTA LMs with some convenient features. - Use cases: Prev use-case + Analyse Trump tweets to understand the topics during the Capitol invasion - 2 Options: Top2vec & BERTopic - Mode: Top2vec (Unsupervised) & BERTopic (can do supervised, semi/guided & DTM). Both follow the same 5 steps, vectorize docs using algorithms (in the likes of Doc2Vec all the way up to Transformers), lower dimensions of docs using UMAP, make clusters using HDBSCAN, calculate centroids (which is the topic) & get Top N similar or closer docs to the centroids. But BERTopic varies in the last 2 steps (which is its weakness) & in the list of vectorization algorithms it supports. Ref the papers for more. - Pros: Both have some nice bells & whistles like search & Viz. The results show both work better with short texts with better coherence & diversity. SoTA vectorization algorithms take care of topic & doc semantics. - Cons: High-quality doc vectors come at a price & can be very slow. The main drawback of BERTTopic is that even though docs are vectorized using semantic vectors the topics are still vectorized using a variant of a BoW called c-TF-IDF. This is still a challenge. 👉 Case C: Your docs are represented by many *correlated* topics. Go for variational inference-based CTM - Correlated topic models. Fx BERTopic assumes "A doc pertains to one topic more than others" but it is far from reality in certain domains.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6943803823261925376?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6943803823261925376%29)

    ML interpretability in the business process is very important. In my experience, business people want to know how the model works rather than the metric evaluation itself. One of the best packages for ML Interpretability is Yellowbrick. Yellowbrick is an open-source Python package that extends the scikit-learn API with visual analysis and diagnostic tools. For Data scientists, Yellowbrick is used to evaluate the model performance and visualize the model behavior. Yellowbrick is a multi-purpose package you could use in everyday modeling work. Even though most of the interpretation API from the Yellowbrick is at the basic level, it is still useful for our first modeling steps.

    How do you research something that doesn’t exist yet? This is a question that researchers at Cruise who are trying to design the consumer-facing experience come up against regularly. Before joining Cruise I worked at Uber, where customers were abundant. It was easy to send a screener survey to 500 customers with a goal of scheduling 10–15 interviews. If we needed to send out a survey, sample sizes were no problem. Walking down the street you were sure to see someone getting in or out of an Uber. Inspiration and information was everywhere. Research is a different story at a startup that has not launched a product yet – especially when the product is unlike anything that existed before. In the years before Cruise received permits to give public rides we did not have any customers to learn from. Legally and technically we could not take people on rides in our cars to observe their first experience with a self-driving car. To help our product and design teams build a ridehail product that the world will love, we needed to explore new methods for conducting research. Check out my Medium post to learn about 5 creative ways we prototyped with self-driving cars. #lifeatcruise[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6942912720828588032?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6942912720828588032%29)

    PiML (π-ML) is a low-code Python library for interpretable machine learning. With it, you can diagnose, interpret and compare all your favorite black-box models ( RF, XGboost, SVM, MLP, etc.) as well as high-performance inherently interpretable models such as 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗕𝗼𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 (EBM), 𝗚𝗔𝗠𝗜-𝗡𝗲𝘁, and 𝗥𝗲𝗟𝘂-𝗗𝗡𝗡. In my book, I call these models glass-box models. 🔥 I highly recommend this last option because you get all the benefits of black-box models with higher interpretability. 🧭 When analyzing models, ML practitioners often stop at the predictive performance, which is like piloting a plane with only one instrument. PiML offers 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 that look at feature importance, partial dependence, reliability, robustness, and resilience, to name a few. I hope you agree that assessing and understanding models on more than one dimension is a better approach. 🌫️ Also, why should you care about model interpretability? Because models with greater interpretability allow us to understand what's going on in the model more clearly because, at the very least, they disentangle 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀. Maybe they even smoothen monotonic relationships as well. Otherwise, it's like operating in foggier conditions. So if you want to be more certain about your conclusions about your model, inherently interpretable models are the way to go. 🚀 𝐺𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑒𝑑: To install PiML, just run this command: 𝚙𝚒𝚙 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝙿𝚒𝙼𝙻 Once you install, please go to the PiML Github to learn more (https://lnkd.in/gT_tBMe8). I have been playing around with this library for the last month, and I'm very impressed with how easy it's to derive meaningful explanations from the dashboards. #MachineLearning #DataScience #Data #XAI #ResponsibleAI #ML #AI #Python #GitHub[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6943539354589958144?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6943539354589958144%29)

    ESVP: A lightning-fast and $$ conscious explainer for transformers is now available in Streamlit cloud as an interim fix. Demo: https://lnkd.in/eCZPpqdm ------- For those who are new to ESVP. Below B-school style, the graph shows where ESVP stands. ESVP is a lightweight, ultra-fast, simple yet novel “model interpretation by feature attribution” technique for HF transformer models that addresses all the below concerns in commodity hardware. Motivation: The principal goal of a model explanation is to offer a transparent view of the “what & why” of a machine’s prediction to humans. Because of this goal historically there was a heavy emphasis on accurate explanations. For instance, 👉For classic models, methods like SHAPELY are really accurate but are additive in nature and by design, it is exhaustive hence it was relatively slower even for classic linear and tree-based models (hence we resorted to faster LIME, though it works locally). 👉For DNNs, back-prop-based methods like Integrated Gradients were really accurate but calculates expensive gradients (both in terms of memory and compute) to derive explanations. (Think about this there is a reason why during inference we deliberately use no-grad to avoid calculating gradients.) 👉Slow and expensive = It's going to cost you an extra $. 👉Today massive transformer models can operate in millisecond inference budget, So it is impractical to have an explanation method or pipeline that has a latency and/or compute needs > inference budget as they aid humans-in-the-loop. Neither extending SHAPELY for transformer models nor latching on to expensive back-prop-based methods makes sense. 👉On the surface it might sound like there are many techniques (Shapley to Integrated Gradients) and libraries (Captum to AllenAI interpret) but if you go beyond scratching the surface almost all incumbent techniques trade-off speed & resource appetite for the accuracy or vice versa. For aficionados, the name takes after RSVP, which translates to “Respond, please”, ESVP translates to “Explain, please”. 😀 #explainableai[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6943174500796530689?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6943174500796530689%29)

    Check out our #CVPR2022 paper where we use a fusion transformer trained with combinatorial loss in order to gain better accuracy on Youcook2/MSR-VTT! paper: https://lnkd.in/ev2frqi2 github link: https://lnkd.in/eEwCSGAW We propose a multi-modal, modality agnostic fusion transformer that learns to exchange information between multiple modalities, such as video, audio, and text, and integrate them into a joined multi-modal representation to obtain an embedding that aggregates multi-modal temporal information. We train the system with a combinatorial loss on everything at once, single modalities as well as pairs of modalities, explicitly leaving out any add-ons such as position or modality encoding. At test time, the resulting model can process and fuse any number of input modalities and process inputs of different lengths. Training on HowTo100M dataset, we show state-of-the-art results in zero-shot video retrieval and zero-shot video action localization.

    Exciting stuff by Google and many others: the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). It currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 442 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. The authors evaluate the behavior of OpenAI’s GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Now for the interesting stuff - findings include: - model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); - performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; - tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit “breakthrough” behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; - social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6940856216424235008?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6940856216424235008%29)

    𝗫𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲: 𝗔 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝗯𝗼𝘅, Fel et al. 2022 Today's most advanced machine-learning models are hardly scrutable. The key challenge for explainability methods is to help assisting researchers in opening up these black boxes, by revealing the strategy that led to a given decision, by characterizing their internal states or by studying the underlying data representation. To address this challenge, authors have developed Xplique: a software library for explainability which includes representative explainability methods as well as associated evaluation metrics. It interfaces with one of the most popular learning libraries: Tensorflow as well as other libraries including PyTorch, scikit-learn and Theano.

    I am starting a new series #back2basicsofDLCV which takes inspiration from Aniket Maurya's #45daysofLightning series. Over the subsequent days(not necessarily consecutive), I will implement standard Vision Architectectures (Classification, detection, segmentation, Generative models, e.t.c.) in Pytorch and Lightning and share my learnings and implementations. The first in the series, I start with implementing Alexnet in PyTorch Lightning and PyTorch with logging using Weights & Biases. I am sharing the Colab and Kaggle notebooks. Pytorch Implementation Colab Notebook: https://lnkd.in/dgppvGFt Pytorch Implementation Kaggle Notebook: https://lnkd.in/da_8bWzY Pytorch Lightning Colab Notebook: https://lnkd.in/dbpTc5fg Pytorch Lightning Kaggle Notebook: https://lnkd.in/dZkbNPMV For the Pytorch implementation, I have taken references from Ben Trevett's image classification tutorials(https://lnkd.in/dTGk6_B2) which have some excellent analyses which I have tried to replicate and wandb logging to track the metrics. For the Pytorch Lightning Implementation, reference is taken from Charles Frye's tutorial (https://lnkd.in/dZ8Kt5YW) on integrating wandb with Pytorch Lightning. I will be releasing a project version(Github repo) with documented code soon for exact replication of results!!

    Title: You thought quantum mechanics was weird: check out entangled time See… https://lnkd.in/eXQG-FAN “In the summer of 1935, the physicists Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger engaged in a rich, multifaceted and sometimes fretful correspondence about the implications of the new theory of quantum mechanics. The focus of their worry was what Schrödinger later dubbed entanglement: the inability to describe two quantum systems or particles independently, after they have interacted. Until his death, Einstein remained convinced that entanglement showed how quantum mechanics was incomplete. Schrödinger thought that entanglement was the defining feature of the new physics, but this didn’t mean that he accepted it lightly. ‘I know of course how the hocus pocus works mathematically,’ he wrote to Einstein on 13 July 1935. ‘But I do not like such a theory.’ Schrödinger’s famous cat, suspended between life and death, first appeared in these letters, a byproduct of the struggle to articulate what bothered the pair. The problem is that entanglement violates how the world ought to work. Information can’t travel faster than the speed of light, for one. But in a 1935 paper, Einstein and his co-authors showed how entanglement leads to what’s now called quantum nonlocality, the eerie link that appears to exist between entangled particles. If two quantum systems meet and then separate, even across a distance of thousands of lightyears, it becomes impossible to measure the features of one system (such as its position, momentum and polarity) without instantly steering the other into a corresponding state. Up to today, most experiments have tested entanglement over spatial gaps. The assumption is that the ‘nonlocal’ part of quantum nonlocality refers to the entanglement of properties across space. But what if entanglement also occurs across time? Is there such a thing as temporal nonlocality.” PS: I’ve been banging on a while about this notion PS: I’ve been banging on a while about this notion!

    This cheat sheet is a condensed version of machine learning manual, which contains many classical equations and diagrams on machine learning, and aims to help you quickly recall knowledge and ideas in machine learning. This cheat sheet has two significant advantages: 1. Clearer symbols. Mathematical formulas use quite a lot of confusing symbols. For example, X can be a set, a random variable, or a matrix. This is very confusing and makes it very difficult for readers to understand the meaning of math formulas. This cheat sheet tries to standardize the usage of symbols, and all symbols are clearly pre-defined 2. Less thinking jumps. In many machine learning books, authors omit some intermediary steps of a mathematical proof process, which may save some space but causes difficulty for readers to understand this formula and readers get lost in the middle way of the derivation process. This cheat sheet tries to keep important intermediary steps as where as possible.

    https://lnkd.in/e5Pzp68v Still an early result but I believe definitely an interesting one in the context of deep learning for spatial reasoning. 3D point clouds have proven to be a preferred representation for object shape prediction owing to their efficiency and capacity in preserving fine-grained details. However, a common issue with predicted point clouds is that they often lack the necessary structure or order for further processing. We propose an intuitive solution to this problem: Spotlights simply predicts point clouds as sampled by a virtual spherical multi-view 3D object scanner. This is the first result of a hopefully fruitful collaboration with Midea. Congrats to Wei Jiaxin for leading this effort.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6940049871190024192?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6940049871190024192%29)

    State-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting is now available in Nixtla 🎉🎉🎉 Recently, at Nixtla, we released the N-HiTS model, significantly improving accuracy and ⚡ computational time (over 50 times) over Transformer-based methods. Today we are excited to make MQN-HiTS available. It combines the N-HiTS with the multi quantile loss enabling it to produce accurate and efficient probabilistic forecasts in long-horizon settings 🔥🔥🔥 You can find a Colab example here: https://lnkd.in/gn4AJXr6 Making predictions for the future involves varying degrees of imperfect or unknown information that translates into uncertainty. For this reason, probabilistic forecasting has emerged as a possible answer to quantify the uncertainty of the future of the target variable, conditioning on the available information of its predictors. We tested the MQN-HiTS model using the M4-Hourly dataset, and we found that even without tuning, it produces faster and more accurate predictions than AutoARIMA + the advantages of probabilistic forecasting. Please check our repo https://lnkd.in/eaWqkF2h and give us a star if you like it. #timeseries #forecasting #uncertainty #deeplearning #machinelearning[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6939533439842869248?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6939533439842869248%29)

    We have absolutely no chance of actually closing the wealth and earning and the learning gaps in America until we intentionally and directly end the neuron connectivity gaps in the first two and first three years of life for each of our children. All children are programmed epigenetically to built neuron connections by the billions and even the trillions and to love doing it in the very first months and years of life and our education systems and our care systems fail us miserably in not making that happen. Let’s give every kid what they need to have that happen. We are a wealthy country and we have enough money to help every child build those resources. The Harvard Brain Hero video could not explain it more clearly. Read this piece and watch that video. Covid just made the horrible learning deficits in our schools worse. Let’s use this opportunity to make sure every kid being born now does not have to fail that badly. Only 15 percent of the students in some schools can do basic math today. Those schools are at fault but only because they didn’t help every child when they were two years old instead of a decade later. Check out these five steps to help our kids. Use them everywhere. Starting now.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6936820776134201344?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6936820776134201344%29)

    We have absolutely no chance of closing the earning gaps or the wealth gaps in our country if a majority of the children in the low-income groups can’t read. We have failed in closing the learning gaps in our country for over three decades — and the number of children in our schools who can’t read e

    Let's start with a stack of documents, and you have no idea about the content of these documents. A common data science approach is to use topic modeling to identify the main topics of all these documents. These topics provide an easy shorthand for starting to understand the content of these documents. The animated image shows the process for topic clustering. It really is that easy! Start with taking your documents and getting them organized into one table. The BERTopic package uses state-of-the-art transformer models to build document embeddings and cluster them into topics. Additionally, BERTopic also offers several easy ways to visualize the final results. My favorite is to view the topics changing over time. If you want more details, check out the BERTopic site and a simple demo I have put together. In this demo, I find topics across 20 years of news headlines. The dataset and code for the app are all open source and available from the demo app. Jump in, this is a very powerful package that is not difficult to use.

    Best programming Languages for Tech Careers (Indeed job posts, June 2022) From a product perspective, it confirms to me that knowing python is pretty much the second best language for many hiring tech roles, and a great starting point for all newcomers into the field.

    Twitter is a social media site where information (and fake news!) spread like wildfire 🔥. Bots discussion apart, it is estimated to have around 330M monthly users. Around 500M tweets are sent everyday. And you can access all that data for free. Let me introduce you to Twint Python package (https://lnkd.in/eyFnATGV). Twint is a high level Python crawling tool that allows to scrape all the information available in Twitter public website without using the official API (limited in terms of the number of tweets that you can collect). “No authentification. No API. No limits”. Twint retrieves all the tweets that belong to a certain author or specific search term/trend/hashtag (yes, all of them!!!) in a customizable time period. It also collects tweet metadata such as author (with followers and following), performance (likes, retweets, favorites), etc. 😱 It is an amazing tool to incorporate in many social media application pipelines: monitoring, impact analysis, trends detection, etc. 100% recommended. Long live open source!! 📈📉 All the credit goes to the original author of the package. Agustín Pineda García #datascience #artificialintelligence #machinelearning #webscraping #twitter #opensource #python #media P.S.: If you do web scraping, you should do it at your own risk. I do not encourage any individual to do it 😉.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6938071807698587648?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6938071807698587648%29)

    ARE YOU A RESEARCHER OR SOMEONE AFRAID TO RESEARCH?? Either way, I have something for you! . . Feeling overwhelmed to change your research direction? or worse Start a new one? or Got a bunch of selected papers to read through?? All the reading, connecting and summarizing can be daunting, luckily AI can help ;) Jump-start your research by just entering your keywords💭 or pre-selected paper ids📚 on my new huggingface🤗 space called Researcher and take a 15 min coffee break ☕, while it churns out your custom literature survey and much more for you to grab !! https://lnkd.in/ejbd_DPz How does it work?? - it compiles a list of papers📚, directly from your set of papers or by fetching relevant papers for your keywords from arXiv, and parses sections(known and new headings) from each - it extracts the images📈, tables📊, sections and section-wise highlights📃, per-paper and organizes all of it - It clusters all of the organized knowledge according to similarity into a few custom topics🗃️, that finally become the custom chapters of your to be generated survey, with their own summarised content and titles - It uses all the knowledge till now with various heuristics to add a custom introduction, abstract, conclusion, references and even a citation tree, to your generated chapters to look like an actual literature survey paper 📔 - it finally gives you a download 📬 of all clustered and un-clustered knowledge as jpgs, txts, pdfs, csvs and even python-joblib dumps for paper highlights + your generated literature survey paper, all in a packed zip file😍 Researching has never been easier to approach 🤓 Fun fact: the streamlit interface creation, 1 year of code maintenance and hugging face integration with debugging and testing (with port forwarding) was done with 0 local compute!! 🤯 All thanks to GitHub codespaces and Hugging Face spaces both are awesome platforms with their own strengths !!

    I read a tweet from Jakob Foerster and thought this might be useful for a lot of people here as well. Jakob has drafted a quick "How to" guide for writing ML papers and he is kind enough to share it as a google doc with everybody. He has touched upon various aspects of writing a paper and has nicely presented it in form of a checklist. I'm sure this would come in handy for people gearing up to write their first papers and having a hard time deciding how to start.

    Unlike other topics in deep learning like #cnn #transformers #nlp #math #machinelearning #reinforcementlearning #mlops and frameworks like #pytorch #tensorflow has innumerable number of resources. There are certain topics like #graphML #geometricDL #multimodal #learning etc are having less relatively lesser number of resources. Though I strongly believe that the number of resources will blow up soon in the future due to it rising popularity. When I started my journey with GraphML, it was really overwhelming for me and I had no idea of how to get started. So I created a list of resources containing #youtube #video links, #books #blogs etc. They are also sorted on the basis of complexity of the content and time taken to finish that. I hope it would help ML aspirants to start their journey with this relatively newer topics. A huge thanks to Petar Veličković Aleksa Gordić Michael Bronstein, Zak Jost, Jure Leskovec an Youtube channel called Deep Findr (unfortunately the person behind that channel is not at LinkedIn) and many other for their awesome content in #Graph #ML and #Geometric #DL. Still have to learn a lot in this field, as it's beauty in its complexity is undeniable. The link is present in the first comment. I am open for feedback and if anyone wants to edit and add more resources just send me an edit request.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6936331185044209664?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6936331185044209664%29)

    What's your go-to reference for Design Patterns in Python? I've gone through some material on design patterns, mostly based on GoF and Head First, and am now looking for Python-specific materials. Less of "here's what we can do" and more of "here's industry best practice". • https://lnkd.in/gh4QR9kF looks like a good one. I like the Python package examples (e.g., logging) and opinions on what to Dodge and Hack. • https://lnkd.in/g5EMCq36 also looks like a good reference with nice visuals and Python examples.

    Introducing the OptFormer, the world's first text-based hyperparameter/blackbox optimizer based on Transformers!! Paper: https://lnkd.in/gF4WTuyk At Google, we possess one of the world's largest hyperparameter optimization databases, over some of Google's most important products and research efforts over the last 5 years. One crucial question is: How can we leverage such data to produce better optimizers? As it turns out, we can simply train a Transformer over such data.

This allows the Transformer to read crucial metadata info like parameter names (e.g. "learning rate"), metric names (e.g. "accuracy"), and descriptions (e.g. "cifar10") to provide a much stronger prior over the objective to be optimized. Even more shocking were the results, which suggest that the Transformer is far more algorithmically and numerically capable than we realize: 1. The Transformer can precisely imitate multiple algorithms simultaneously - if we prompt the algorithm name (e.g. "Hill Climbing"), the Transformer will produce its behavior exactly. 2. It can also predict objective output values MUCH more accurately than Gaussian Processes, especially because the Transformer can read textual metadata cues. 3. By combining 1+2 using model-based techniques, we're able to produce tuning algorithms that outperform even our industry standard Google Vizier optimizer. We hope that this is the first step to a universal model for hyperparameter optimization and general intelligence for AutoML systems. This was a huge collaborative effort between Deepmind and Google Brain, with numerous amazing coauthors: Yutian Chen, Chansoo Lee, Zi Wang, Qiuyi Zhang, David Dohan, Kazuya Kawakami, Greg Kochanski, Arnaud Doucet, Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Sagi Perel, and Nando de Freitas.

    Have you ever compared explainability using SHAP to the ground truth? For Black box models we don’t have the ground truth. But, for inherently interpretable models such as EBM or GAMI-Net, there are ground truth because the explanation are exact. Try this Colab notebook example and see how SHAP can be very wrong even for simple data such as California Housing Price data. Compare SHAP to LIME and exact interpretability of EBM and GAMI-Net. https://lnkd.in/gaEynC3M #doyoustilltrustSHAP?[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6932552453041127424?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6932552453041127424%29)

However as Systems Thinkng is a sub discipline of Cybernetics (a word derived from Governance, Regulator, or Steersman) perhaps this is to be expected.

    How do we quickly merge data without Mircosoft Excel? . Here are 5 useful pandas functions for production data analysis. 🔹 Concat: this function supports the vertical and horizontal combination of two tables. Concat can quickly combine the data from different shards. 🔹 Append: this function supports the adding of data to an existing table. Append can be used in web crawlers. The new data can be appended to the table when it is crawled. 🔹 Merge: this function supports horizontal combination on keys. It works similarly to database joins. Merge can be used to combine data from different domains with the same keys. 🔹 Join: this function works similarly to database outer joins. 🔹 Combine: this function can apply calculations while combining two tables. The example below chooses the smaller value for the cell. Combine is useful for a data cleansing process. Over to you: do you have any tricks which you use during production data analysis, especially during outages when the pressure is on? — If you enjoy these posts, you might like my ByteByteGo System Design newsletter.

Neural network architectures with height, width, and depth as hyperparameters are called three-dimensional architectures. It is shown that neural networks with three-dimensional architectures are significantly more expressive than the ones with two-dimensional architectures (those with only width and depth as hyperparameters), e.g., standard fully connected networks. The new network architecture is constructed recursively via a nested structure, and hence we call a network with the new architecture nested network (NestNet). #architecture #network #neuralnetworks #deeplearning[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6933780715700371456?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6933780715700371456%29)

With so many people on LinkedIn reading my posts, I’m extremely grateful. Here are some sample topics: 🔹 Why is Redis fast? 🔹 How to scale a website to support millions of users? 🔹 How does HTTPs work? 🔹 What happens when you type a URL into your browser? 🔹 How to avoid double charge? 🔹 Why is Kafka fast? I hope this PDF can be helpful. I will update the content monthly by uploading a new PDF.

The repo contains my class notes from the advanced course Algorithms in Data Mining given in Tel Aviv University during academic years 2011-2012-2013. These notes are intended to be used freely by academics anywhere, students and professors alike. The class notes contain simple algorithms needed in the analysis of large amounts of data. The algorithms are presented in their most basic form for didactic reasons. The proofs for the provided algorithms correctness is also designed to be as simple as possible, self contained, and presentable in roughly one long frontal session. An advanced undergraduate or graduate student with some hands-on experience in probability, linear algebra, algorithms, and combinatorics should be able to follow this course.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6932483548939513856?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6932483548939513856%29)

    You can improve your chances for work or business by dressing for success. Good news: one suit is good enough for most corporate settings. This is a way that 5 suits can be used to create 75 suits. Over the past year I did not expect to be advising executives on their wardrobe and appearance, but it has been a pleasure to help so many. I like recommending people who are helping people improve their chances. I recommend that you follow @ladariuscampbell on IG for great color combinations.

    #Yocto and #ROS 2 allow you to build a #production-grade custom operating system for #robots. Here's why and how you get #ROS2 #Humble into your #Yocto and #PetaLinux projects. Industrial-grade #embedded systems often rely on strong multidisciplinary engineering teams that build custom Linux distributions for production by leveraging Yocto, a project to build embedded #Linux. Rationale is that instead of relying on common development-oriented Linux distros (such as #Debian or #Ubuntu), Yocto allows you to build a customized Linux system for your use case. This provides you with an unmatched granularity wherein you can customize from the bootloader, going through the Linux kernel, and all the way into userspace libraries, such as those required to enable ROS 2 support. With the advent of ROS 2 Humble, to support companies porting to ROS 2, here's a writeup on how to bring ROS 2 Humble to Yocto and PetaLinux projects which derives from https://lnkd.in/eSHjUphb. Kudos to Lukas Bulwahn, Martin Jansa, Herb Kuta, Dmitry Rozhkov and many others for maintaining meta-ros over time.

    Flight simmers! This is the 5th and last episode on the application of #Matlab #Reinforcement #Learning Toolbox to flight control. This video wraps up the work conducted by me and my student Paolo Maria D'Onza on how classical flight control techniques compare to those based on AI. Typical autopilot systems for fixed-wing airplanes are made up of nested PID controllers, whose design often needs a careful gain tuning, and may become vulnerable to control instability in disturbed flight situations. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, on the other hand, provide the possibility to implement *agents* (controllers) that are able to learn from interactions with their surrounding space and subsequent state transitions. When an agent is trained with *Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL)* techniques, there is the possibility to spread its control experience over many unusual possible states and correction actions. This becomes an important feature of the learning process in order to obtain good control skills within feasible learning times. This work investigates the use of DRL to manage and control a fixed wing high-performance aircraft. We have chosen a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent, having studied the successful applications of this particular approach in other domains. In our particular application to flight control, our attention has been focused on the design of suitable *reward functions*, which encode the behavior we wanted the agent to learn. Starting from easy tasks, such as the straight and leveled flight control, it was possible to successfully train an agent to control more complex tasks, such as following a sequence of randomly generated waypoints. This unlocked the possibility to simulate a prey-chaser scenario. Finally, the agent control capabilities have been compared to those of a conventional autopilot. The good news is that an DRL agent performs reasonably well! In this work, the chosen high-performance airplane is the F-16. The F-16 flight dynamics model is provided by the #JSBSim flight simulation software library, exposed to the simulation environment via its Matlab/Simulink interface. *Tools* Matlab Reinforcement Learning toolbox 👉 https://lnkd.in/dTvasqSK JSBSim on GitHub 👉 https://lnkd.in/daGz4wa Credits: Jon Berndt, Sean McLeod, Bertrand Coconnier, Agostino De Marco, Brian Mills JSBSim Matlab interface on Windows 👉 https://lnkd.in/djPmRVe9 F-16 model details 👉 https://lnkd.in/d3nYGvdT FCS details 👉 https://lnkd.in/dhQjNxaq Episode 1 here: https://lnkd.in/grFZScEE Episode 2 here: https://lnkd.in/g9vzssCk Episode 3 here: https://lnkd.in/dDGcGxMA Episode 4 here: https://lnkd.in/g6zeVcBc #reinforcementlearning #flightsimulation #flightdynamics #flightcontrol #deeplearning #aircraft[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6930166624477999104?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6930166624477999104%29)

    What action space should you choose to train deep control policies for quadrotors? Check out our #ICRA2022 paper "A Benchmark Comparison of Learned Control Policies for Agile Quadrotor Flight"! We present the first benchmark comparison of existing learned control policies for agile quadrotor flight and show that training control policies that command body rates and collective thrust results in more robust sim-to-real transfer compared to training policies that directly specify individual rotor thrusts. Paper: https://lnkd.in/euxzDQ8U Narrated Video: https://lnkd.in/epkYcRTH Quadrotors are highly nonlinear dynamical systems that require carefully tuned controllers to be pushed to their physical limits. Recently, learning-based control policies have been proposed for quadrotors, as they would potentially allow learning direct mappings from high-dimensional raw sensory observations to actions. Due to sample inefficiency, training such learned controllers on the real platform is impractical or even impossible. Training in simulation is attractive but requires to transfer policies between domains, which demands trained policies to be robust to such domain gap. In this work, we make two contributions: (i) we perform the first benchmark comparison of existing learned control policies for agile quadrotor flight and show that training a control policy that commands body rates and thrust results in more robust sim-to-real transfer compared to a policy that directly specifies individual rotor thrusts, (ii) we demonstrate for the first time that such a control policy trained via deep reinforcement learning can control a quadrotor in real-world experiments at speeds over 45km/h.

    In the literature, behavioral car-following (CF) models and ACC algorithms are usually applied to mimic longitudinal dynamics of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), respectively. However, from a modelling viewpoint, there is no reason to prefer CF models to simulate HVs, and ACC algorithms to simulate AVs. After all, when simulating a mixed traffic, we retain almost the same level of ignorance about the true dynamics of HVs and AVs. In this paper (https://lnkd.in/dpMuHUq5) we investigated what the ability of ACC algorithms from the literature is to capture the measured dynamics of commercial ACC-equipped vehicles, and whether the consolidated habit of applying linear control laws – and not behavioral CF models – to simulate AVs has significance in practice. Results are surprising! It was a great pleasure to work with Yinglong He, Konstantinos Mattas, Vincenzo Punzo and Biagio Ciuffo! #autonomousvehicles #adaptivecruisecontrol #mixedtraffic[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6927523449808510976?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6927523449808510976%29)

    Hallerbach et al. published earlier this year a pre-print on Simulation-Enabled Methods for Development, Test, and Validation of Cooperative and Automated Vehicles, based on their SAE WCX toolchain proposal from April 2018 and a Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences workshop in 2020 - The release and public deployment of cooperative and automated vehicles remains a major challenge for the automotive industry. Despite the recent progress made by worldwide initiatives in this field, i.a. by the PEGASUS family of projects, the demand for comprehensive simulation-enabled development, test and validation methodologies of cooperative and automated driving rises even further. In addition, the number of applications can be expected to grow as well. Especially integrated AI components are inherent complex systems that require automated simulation-enabled standardized methods and tools over the complete development and application chain. The procedures need to be automatically set up and configured allowing for a so-called “as a service” approach. Therefore, a proposal of an open testing architecture that operates similarly to a “bus system” using standardized components and interfaces is introduced. This enables a step towards a plug-and-play testing approach that supports independence and exchangeability of components, systems-under-test, operational environments, scenarios, etc. In this way, such an open testing architecture can be optimally utilized for scenario-based testing, which currently seems to be the winning strategy to ensure safety for cooperative and automated vehicles. Development and testing throughout the entire spectrum of simulation-enabled methods, such as MiL, SiL, XiL, and PiL, are supported up to non-virtual testing on proving grounds and traffic systems --> Citation Information: S.

    Computing time-optimal trajectories for #quadcopters can now be done in just 10ms and onboard! This helps withstand both wind and dynamic environments! Check out our paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and its follow-up paper: PDF: https://lnkd.in/e8c9Azyq Video: https://lnkd.in/eF5SAZuV PDF: https://lnkd.in/eakmSvAk Video: https://lnkd.in/eBax5_Hs We tackle the problem of flying time-optimal trajectories through multiple waypoints with quadrotors. State-of-the-art solutions split the problem into a planning task (where a global, time-optimal trajectory is generated) and a control task (where this trajectory is accurately tracked). However, at the current state, generating a time-optimal trajectory that considers the full quadrotor model requires solving a difficult time allocation problem via optimization, which can take up to several hours. This is detrimental for replanning in presence of disturbances, such as wind or dynamic gates and obstacles. We overcome this issue by solving the time allocation problem and the control problem concurrently via Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC). Our #MPCC optimally selects the future states of the platform at runtime, while maximizing the progress along the reference path and minimizing the distance to it. We show that, even when tracking simplified trajectories, the proposed MPCC results in a path that approaches the true time-optimal one, and which can be generated in real-time. In a follow-up paper, we show how these trajectories can be replanned on the fly to adapt to changes in the environment. We showcase this adaptation capability by flying a quadrotor at more than 60 km/h on a racing track where gates are moving. Additionally, we show that our online replanning approach can cope with strong disturbances caused by winds of up to 68 km/h.

I actually think all these things contribute more to burnout: - lack of alignment (rowing in opposite directions) - lack of winning (losing causes burnout fast) - lack of proper incentives and recognition - lack of excitement about the vision (gotta be inspired) - lack of progress personally - lack of trust - lack of clear ownership and directive of what success looks like (more detailed than vision) - lack of enjoying working with the people on your team Lots of people love to work, but you'll get burnout from those things ^[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6922324732847476736?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6922324732847476736%29)

    My System Design preparation behind receiving a lot of offers. Freshworks was the first company I interviewed with for the System Design round ever, and I absolutely got wrecked in the round. I was not able to explain things about consistent hashing in a load balancer, trade-offs between why I chose NoSQL vs Relational DB, etc. Post 4 of 7 in my Interview Prep & Job Search. For others who have no idea what this is all about, I've linked the first post in the comments section. Check it if you feel like it. I started my HLD prep around December 2021 end, went to YouTube, and watched the famous Gaurav Sen playlist. Made notes after watching all the 37 videos from his playlist and used to revise them every morning and every night before sleep for a month. Attached the notes with the post (apologies for my terrible handwriting). Bought two books - "System Design Interview - An Insider's Guide" by Alex Xu, and "Designing data-intensive applications" by Martik Kleppmann as well. They're probably the best purchases I made in my career. I went through Alex Xu's book at least 15-20 times during my entire preparation journey. I also searched the entire youtube and made a personal playlist containing all the system design mock interviews existing on Youtube. There were around 50ish videos I found and I went through every single one of them. I'll leave the link to the playlist in the comments. Whenever I had an HLD interview, I used to revise the personal notes I made from Gaurav Sen videos and I also used to skim through the entire Alex Xu book as well. I got to a point where I was able to skim through the entire 300-page book in 20 mins. That's how many times I read and understood the book over and over again. After Freshworks, I never failed a single system design round. It became my strongest topic ever. Received the highest possible ratings in all my HLD rounds with all companies except with LinkedIn (made a terrible mistake with DB schema). I had a buddy, Nagasree kasa, we used to study HLD together and used to explain to each other the concepts we learned every alternative day. That tremendously helped in cementing what we learned. I asked my friend Sruthi Yagnavajjula to take an HLD mock interview. Being from a non-technical background, she gave me very positive feedback about my explanations and architecture and I also understood how I should approach and explain an HLD problem statement during the interviews. They both helped me realize that my system design skills were pretty good (Not bragging by any means). I had a habit of reading engineering blogs of many companies before, but I never focused that deeply. I used to do it as a hobby, but after I started HLD preparation, I must say I fell in love with System Design as a whole. I've attached my notes, Youtube playlist I made, links to both books in the post & comments section.

    Still using cross-entropy loss or focal loss? Perhaps surprisingly, there is room for improvement here. Now you have a better choice: PolyLoss. Our just released ICLR’22 paper shows: with one line of code (see image), Polyloss improves all image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, sometimes by a significant margin. Our Polyloss paper examines the Taylor expansion series of the losses and the effects of changing their coefficients. We find the leading term is the most important one, and simply adjusting it can result in significant gains on a diverse set of SOTA models. What is interesting is that different settings need different epsilon: positive, or negative.

𝗔𝗻𝘀: AutoTinyBERT and AutoTinyBERT-Fast have 100 and 8 architectures (×1.5 V100 GPU hour) respectively to be tested in the search process. 🔸 AutoTinyBERT performs further 5 epochs (×58 V100 GPU hours) training for top three architectures, BERT is trained from scratch with 10 epochs, and AutoTinyBERTFast does the further training for one architecture. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 : 🔸 In this paper, they introduced the one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to perform the automatic hyper-parameter optimization on efficient PLMs, named as AutoTinyBERT. 🔸 AutoTinyBERT not only consistently outperforms the BERT with conventional hyper-parameters under different latency constraints, but also outperforms NAS-BERT based on neural architecture search. 🔸 In task-agnostic BERT distillation, AutoTinyBERT outperforms a series of existing SOTA methods of DistilBERT, TinyBERT and MobileBERT. 🔸 They explore the problem of how to design hyper-parameters for efficient PLMs and introduce an effective and efficient method: AutoTinyBERT. 🔸 Summarize a fast rule and it develops an AutoTinyBERT for a specific constraint with even about 50% of the training time of a conventional PLM. 🔸 Train AutoTinyBERT in both ways of pretraining and task-agnostic BERT distillation. 🔸 For task agnostic distillation, we follow the first stage of TinyBERT except that only the last-layer loss is used, and ELECTRAbase is used as the teacher model. 🔸 Our method outperforms NAS-BERT that is built with the non-identical layer and heterogeneous modules, which shows that the proposed method is effective for the architecture search of efficient PLMs. 🔸 AutoTinyBERT is efficient and its development time is twice that of the conventional method (BERT) and the result is improved by about 1.8%. 🔸 AutoTinyBERT-Fast achieves a competitive score of 77.6 by only about 50% of BERT training time. 🔸 Moreover, AutoTinyBERT achieves comparable results with MobileBERT, and its inference speed is 1.5× faster. #NLP #artificialintelligence #data #learning #technology[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6925688422359535616?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6925688422359535616%29)

    Topic Modelling: Intentionally short primer and A mental model. After Philip Vollet’s post on Top2Vec, many of you pinged. So here you go. 👉 Criteria A: Discover topics in a corpus with long-form docs of size: small to medium & you are open to dealing with cleanup (stop words), muck with hyper-parameters & involve HITL to assign readable topics. - Use cases: Analyse employee emails (long-form) to understand the top N topics that lead to mass resignations. - 2 Options: Matrix factorisation (MF)-based & Probabilistic sampling-based. - Mode: Unsupervised A variant of MF: Decompose a term-doc frequency matrix A into W & H (in W, all rows (i) are docs & cols (j) are words, in H, all rows are words & cols are topics). Imagine Wij. Hjk. K is the number of topics & it is manually chosen. Idea is to reduce i.e ||A-W.H||. If SVD is used for MF then it’s LSA. The probabilistic variation of it is pLSA. Another variation of pLSA is NMF. But if you do this probabilistically using sampling tech like Gibbs sampling then it’s LDA. - Pros: The topics are open for good human interpretations. - Cons: By default word is the tactical unit, word order & context are ignored (Though you could play with the ngram range while generating a term-doc matrix, it’s still a BoW). You are also at the mercy of the implementation, I have “heard” Mallet is “decent”. Finally, Can’t handle a huge corpus. 👉 Criteria B: Discover topics in a corpus of long or short texts & you don’t want to deal with corpus cleanup, a lot of hyper-parameters, leveraging SoTA LMs with some convenient features. - Use cases: Prev use-case + Analyse Trump tweets to understand the topics during the Capitol invasion - 2 Options: Top2vec & BERTopic - Mode: Top2vec (Unsupervised) & BERTopic (can do supervised, semi/guided & DTM). Both follow the same 5 steps, vectorize docs using algorithms (in the likes of Doc2Vec all the way up to Transformers), lower dimensions of docs using UMAP, make clusters using HDBSCAN, calculate centroids (which is the topic) & get Top N similar or closer docs to the centroids. But BERTopic varies in the last 2 steps (which is its weakness) & in the list of vectorization algorithms it supports. Ref the papers for more. - Pros: Both have some nice bells & whistles like search & Viz. The results show both works better with short texts with better coherence & diversity. SoTA vectorization algorithms take care of topic & doc semantics. - Cons: High-quality doc vectors come at a price & can be very slow. The main drawback of BERTTopic is that even though docs are vectorized using semantic vectors the topics are still vectorized using a variant of a BoW called c-TF-IDF. This is still a challenge. 👉 Criteria C: Your docs are represented by many *correlated* topics. Go for variational inference-based CTM - Correlated topic models. Fx BERTopic assumes "A doc pertains to one topic more than others" but it is far from reality in certain domains. #lsa #lda #top2vec[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6925757992227250176?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6925757992227250176%29)

    How did I manage tremendous amounts of companies and interviews? Post 2 of 7 in my Interview Prep & Job Search. For others who have no idea what this is all about, I've linked the first post in the comments section. Check it if you feel like it. So, how did I do it? Two Words - Notion & Google Calendar Every single day I used to follow up with multiple recruiters about updates on the interview process. I used to set REMINDERS, and TASKS on my Google Calendar every day so that I don't forget which company recruiter to contact for an update on which day! I've put all the companies applied, the rounds, the role, the team, and every single piece of information on a notion page (close to 70 companies, look at the image attached). This notion page also consisted of links to my resume, LinkedIn profile, leetcode profile for quick access, template messages to send to recruiters and employees for referrals, and also a couple of motivational quotes for me to see when I felt low. This Notion page was my single source of truth, it had links to job openings from company careers pages, emails, people whom I reached out to for referrals, and discussions I had with recruiters & hiring managers about the work, role, tech stack, team, interview structure, status in each round, and a lot more. But still, no matter how organized and planned I tried to be, things always fell out of place. I was ghosted by several companies. I kept trying to reach out to them for closure, either a yes or no. I mailed them, called them, and dropped them messages over LinkedIn for updates. Few of them were kind enough to give an answer, most of them were not. Btw, I've applied to many companies right from January itself, though I wanted to apply from February/March. The reason being, I know that the processes will take time so I started early.

    How I prepared for my Meta technical interviews: 1) Studying data structures Ex. Lists, strings, linked lists, heaps, dictionaries, stacks, queues, graphs. I reviewed each data structure’s implementation and time complexity for various operations in Python, my preferred language. ⭐ Resources • Dhaval Patel's Python DSA playlist lnkd.in/gyb4uFaV • Big-O Cheat Sheet lnkd.in/gsHUuGQ8 • UC Berkeley Data Structures course lnkd.in/g5cXVFMm 2) LeetCode I solved around 90 questions, including all Easy and Medium questions on Facebook Top 50 Tagged. I revisited each question after at least 1 week. I logged each question I solved in Notion with a brief solution, relevant topics, and time complexity. This helped me to genuinely understand each solution before moving on. I wish I’d followed a strategy for LeetCoding, such as the Blind 75. By solving questions randomly, I took longer to develop an intuition for noticing and applying patterns. ⭐ Resources • Sean Prashad LeetCode Patterns lnkd.in/gNnUYgcW • leetcode.com/ • Blind 75 lnkd.in/gKXwTqa5 / Blind 50 lnkd.in/gA9MFEYM 3) Mock interviews I did 2 mock interviews with a friend and practiced talking through some solutions as I LeetCoded. ⭐ Resources* • pramp.com/#/ • interviewing.io (Paid) *I didn’t use these myself, but they were recommended by others. What worked for me this time may not work for you. I’m still discovering the best approach for me, and I encourage you to as well. --- Learn more about interview prep at Superposition VI, the Bay Area's largest all-women and non-binary hackathon (virtual, 6/17-19) → bit.ly/sp6_register.

    We (Naresh and I) have been working on our Efficient Deep Learning book for a while with a top computer science book publisher. The book seeks to help the readers optimize their deep learning models, which we feel is a very relevant and timely topic. However, we realized that we were imposing constraints on the book because of the economic aspects of book publishing. For instance, why shouldn't the e-book be free for everyone to read? It shouldn't be under lock and key in a walled garden. Sure, we don't earn any royalties from those who just grab the PDF, but that's not what we are in it for. Another one: Why shouldn't the physical book have images in color, and syntax-highligted code? For publishers, it is way more profitable to print in black-and-white. However, we can self-publish in color and sell it at cost since we don't need to make a profit. Those who do want a physical book should actually be able to enjoy that experience. We are not in the book publishing business. I probably won't pick up such a big endeavor either in the future, but we want to do it right this one time. So starting now we are just going to put the PDFs and the codelabs / tutorials online for everyone to read and play with at: efficientdlbook.com. We have the first four chapters and the related codelabs available now, with more coming soon! We hope that by putting the book out there, we will get the feedback that we need to improve the book, and readers can access the content as it evolves. In the words of the Incredible Hulk, "I see this as an absolute win!". Please report errata / feedback at: https://lnkd.in/g7RXWCCx, and/or feel free to write to us at hello@efficientdlbook.com if you would like to collaborate / review / help in any capacity.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6923712950696366080?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6923712950696366080%29)

I didn’t have a technical background, but I found SQL’s syntax, unlike that of many other programming languages, straightforward and easy to implement. 🎯 For example, you run SELECT * on a SQL table to make every row and column appear. You simply use the JOIN keyword to return rows of data from different related tables, which you can then further group, sort, and analyze. 🎯 I discovered SQL to be a powerful language, one that fundamentally shaped my understanding of what you can — and can’t— do with data. SQL excels at bringing order to messy, large data sets and helps you discover how different data sets are related. Plus, its queries and functions are easy to reuse within the same project or even in a different database.

The goal is to learn how to transform unlabelled #pointcloud data through unsupervised segmentation with K-Means clustering. Because if you are on the quest for a (Supervised) #deeplearning algorithm for your object recognition tasks — keywords alert 😁 — you certainly have found yourself searching for some high-quality labels + a high quantity of data points. 😉 Here is the open link: https://lnkd.in/eXscTSd5 I made sure to include everything as standalone: ✔️ Some theory to shine some light on obscure parts ✔️ The full step-by-step tutorial for the python implementation ✔️ The dataset from the Aerial LiDAR HD Campaign by IGN - French Mapping Agency (Institut Géographique National) ✔️ The Open-Source Code available on Google and GitHub Enjoy the read 👌!

    Cruise says its autonomous vehicle (i.e., does not require a human driver) had its headlights off at night "because of a human error." If your plan is to blame humans when your autonomous vehicle gets pulled over for traffic violations, how is it still autonomous? Either you have all the safety angles covered, or you shouldn't be doing public road testing without a safety driver. Cruise says "we have fixed the issue that led to this" with no further details. Does that mean they fired the person who made the mistake (hint: that doesn't fix the problem)? Or that they did a top-do-bottom revisit of their safety case and SMS to find out how something so obvious went wrong? Getting easy stuff like this wrong with poor transparency does not build trust. Thus far they haven't done much to earn the benefit of the doubt here. (Ended up writing a more detailed discussion of concerns this incident causes here: https://lnkd.in/eFdrmvrU )[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6919813516275179521?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6919813516275179521%29)

    ## San Francisco police stop self-driving car – and find nobody inside, video shows
    
    A video recently posted online shows what happens when police try to apprehend an autonomous vehicle – only to find nobody inside. Police in San Francisco stopped a vehicle operated by Cruise, an autonomous car company backed by General Motors, in a video posted on 1 April . Officers approached the

    Highly recommended: "Interpretable Machine Learning: Fundamental Principles and 10 Grand Challenges" by Cynthia Rudin, Chaofan Chen, Zhi Chen, Haiyang Huang, Lesia Semenova, and Chudi Zhong Interpretability in machine learning (ML) is crucial for high-stakes decisions and troubleshooting. In this work, we provide fundamental principles for interpretable ML, and dispel common misunderstandings that dilute the importance of this crucial topic. We also identify 10 technical challenge areas in interpretable machine learning and provide history and background on each problem. Some of these problems are classically important, and some are recent problems that have arisen in the last few years. These problems are: (1) Optimizing sparse logical models such as decision trees; (2) Optimization of scoring systems; (3) Placing constraints into generalized additive models to encourage sparsity and better interpretability; (4) Modern case-based reasoning, including neural networks and matching for causal inference; (5) Complete supervised disentanglement of neural networks; (6) Complete or even partial unsupervised disentanglement of neural networks; (7) Dimensionality reduction for data visualization; (8) Machine learning models that can incorporate physics and other generative or causal constraints; (9) Characterization of the “Rashomon set” of good models; and (10) Interpretable reinforcement learning. This survey is suitable as a starting point for statisticians and computer scientists interested in working in interpretable machine learning. #artificialintelligence #KI #machinelearning #DataScience #XAI #Interpretabilty #transparency #algorithms #explainableai #dataviz[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6919340488172924929?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6919340488172924929%29)

    It's insane that this book is completely free... "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" is among the most respected books on ML. For a good reason, too. It's ever-so slightly out of touch with the state-of-the-art, but it makes up for this with greater emphasis on statistics theory that most other books don't include. It's a phenomenal piece of literature for anyone interested in the subject. If you'd like to get a digital copy, simply click this link to Microsoft's site, download pdf, and enjoy!

    😭 You've stumbled across a complicated shell script that you don't understand. At. All. What do you do? 🧐 You might be tempted to try to either manually google search the different arguments. You might all try to hit --help or man to pull up the docs. There's a better way. The https://explainshell.com/ way. Copy-pasta the entire line or script and get back documentation for each part in a single page. Screenshot is one of the examples from their page. Super useful for looking up curl commands since most of the cheatsheets out there have a fraction of the commands used out in the wild. (Although this one: https://buff.ly/37Zya3I is good enough for majority of use cases) Edit: This is not my project, just a tool I've found SUPER nifty -- I'll see if I can track down & tag the actual creator of the project on here so they get the proper kudos.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6914224749887852544?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6914224749887852544%29)

    "Graph Neural Networks are Dynamic Programmers" by Andrew Dudzik na d Petar Veličković " ... GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming (DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. .."

    A lot of ‘influencers’ recommend their list of 50+ books but don’t tell you how to choose the right books for YOU + how to read. Here’s the framework I use to solve for both those things: First identify your phase in life to choose the right books: 👉Phase #1) The “sponge” phase: In this phase, you have time on your hands to explore different ideas/ topics. Read everything/ anything that you can get your hands on: there’s no need for book recommendations. The focus should be on consuming large volumes of material, and exponentially increasing your reading speed. 👉Phase #2) The synthesis phase: When you’re thinking about starting something new/ going on a new adventure, stir the pot in your brain: you’ve fed it well in phase #1. Let your brain connect the dots from all the topics you’ve learned about. The books you thought were most irrelevant usually end up being bridges- don’t underestimate any book. 👉Phase #3) The “execution” phase: There’s no time for leisurely reading at this stage- you’re already working on something. You’ll crave bullet-sized bits of info to fill the holes in your knowledge to propel yourself to the next level. The information age is over, this is the curation phase. Find experts in your domain: they’ve already read all the books/ made the mistakes you’re trying to avoid. You just need to suck out all the information from their brains- fast. Annoy them endlessly with questions over coffee, read everything they mention- fast, fill the gaps of info that you have, find another expert, rinse and repeat. If you try to jump between phases, you’re going to lose. You can’t skip steps. Here are 3 other common mistakes people make with reading books: 🐒Mistake #1) Not taking notes I go back and re-read my notes in the margins all the time. Helps tons. 🐒Mistake #2) Mental masturbation Reading without producing outcomes is like mental masturbation- it’s useless. If you want the whole experience(pun intended)- go out, test out what you learn in every book, rinse and repeat with every new one. 🐒Mistake #3) Relying heavily on book recommendations Big mistake. Different people are at different phases of their life, contextual relevance is underrated. Sometimes similar people get different amounts of value from the same book. You have your own path, fearlessly navigate it. The dots will connect for you in your own unique way. Hope this helps! Sending hugs your way if you need them today 🤗 FullCircle[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6914606325003919360?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6914606325003919360%29)

    Something that does not get said enough- R is alive and well in production environments across the globe. Does this mean that I do not like Python? Absolutely not. I prefer Python for ETL and automation tasks. Does this mean that R cannot perform those tasks? No; however, it is personal preference. What type of business activities do I prefer R? 1. Dashboards- Shiny is an awesome application with great documentation (If you are new to my posts, I would not be in the data world without documentation). 2. Health Analytics- R has several packages that make analyzing healthcare data efficient, effective, and visually appealing. Additionally, data cleaning in R (Tidyverse, and the list goes on). 3. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)- If I am doing research that involves SEM, I prefer R. UCLA's Advanced Research Computing for Statistical Methods and Data Analytics has detailed and awesome examples. I provide the R resources for each area listed above in the comments. Have a great weekend, and do not discount the value of R in your analytics, data science, or machine learning toolbox. #datascience #machinelearning #analytics #bigdata #rstudio #technology[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6913794343648559105?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6913794343648559105%29)

    ✨ Are 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁 to 𝘀𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀? 🎈 Last Thursday researchers from University of Wisconsin-Madison released a brand new paper analyzing the robustness of ViT model to spurious correlations. 🔹 𝗦𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 are relationships within the data that co-occur with features of interest, being 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 rather than essential 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 of these features. 🔹 Most machine learning models will leverage such spurious relationships as long as they have enough explanatory power, which might 𝗵𝘂𝗿𝘁 these model's 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆. 🔹 𝗖𝗡𝗡s are known to fall into the trap of 𝘀𝗽𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. How about Transformers? 🔹 To address this question, the authors compare 𝗩𝗶𝗧 models with a number of CNN architecutres (BiT / Big Transfer). 🔹 Results? 🔹 It turns out that 𝗩𝗶𝗧 models are significantly 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁 against spurious correlations 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗖𝗡𝗡s. 🔹 Yet 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀! 🔹 𝗩𝗶𝗧s 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗖𝗡𝗡s under 𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲-𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲-𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 data regime, but when the pre-training dataset is 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 Transformer models significantly 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 CNNs of comparable size. 🔹 Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that Transformers robustness against spurious correlations is related to the global attention. 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 the 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘀𝗰𝗼𝗽𝗲 to local, 𝗱𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝘀 the models' 𝗿𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀. 💎💎💎 🔹 A very interesting result in the context of causality and invariance research! _______________________________________________________ 💡 Paper: https://lnkd.in/d-gyJvAW 💡 Repo: https://lnkd.in/dfayN6di 💡 Authors: SOUMYA SUVRA GHOSAL, Yifei Ming, Sharon Yixuan Li 🎈 Join over 2.9k researchers and practitioners.

    [Hyperparameter Tuning Knowledge Transfer from Small to Huge Network] Recently, Microsoft just published a paper on performing hyperparameter tuning on a small network that can be transferrable to a larger network, whether it is larger in width, depth, sequence length for the Transformers network, and even the training time! What does this mean? It means that we can perform hyperparameter tuning only on a smaller network, with of course much less computational cost, then transfer the best set of hyperparameters we get to the original huge network that we have, let's say the almighty GPT-3. In fact, the authors show that they outperformed published numbers of the 6.7B GPT-3 model, by performing hyperparameter tuning on a 40M GPT-3 down-sized model, with the tuning cost only 7% of the total pertaining cost! How is it possible? All of this can happen thanks to the technique of hyperparameters parameterization, called µP (read: mu-P). Note that, this is not a hyperparameter tuning method, but it is a procedure to perform hyperparameter tuning on parameterized hyperparameters based on µP. This is indeed a very interesting paper! It is worth sparing some of your time to read this paper, as attached in the comment section below :) BONUS: They have implemented this method and open-sourced it! You can see the link to the repo in the comment section below :) Please share your thoughts after reading the paper. Happy learning! #artificialintelligence #machinelearning[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6909710450087653376?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6909710450087653376%29)

    How do I stay on top of TECH TRENDS? 1. Make it Part of My Job Staying up-to-date on the latest tech trends would drives massive value for my team. Have a channel for your team to share news and trends. 2. Network I’m in 10+ different tech groups on Slack, iMessage, & WhatsApp. Become a magnet for your friends when it comes to a specific niche (everyone texts me cool AI links). 3. Subscribe to Newsletters CB Insights and Axios Pro Rata are two of my favorites. 4. Curate Your Feed Follow tech thought leaders on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and TikTok, as well as hashtags (ex: #machinelearning). Create Twitter lists, set weekly Google alerts for topics you love. 5. Time Block It’s not about having time; it’s about making it. Set aside one hour every week to read, research, find new people, comb through feeds, and catch up on papers you’ve bookmarked. I’ll also add: for every new topic I try and learn, the first few months is constant searching and outreach. Then, through algorithms and mechanisms set up, it’s low to no lift (other than reading) to learn. So kick it off now. Start one text thread. Set one Google Alert.

    Pingouin is a library based on NumPy and pandas that offers a variety of statistical tests, including T-test, Pearson correlation, ANOVA, Chi-Square and many more. This library is a great alternative to SciPy, as it supports pandas dataframes and provides detailed results for each test. For example, the ttest_ind() function of SciPy returns only the T-value and p-value. In comparison, the ttest() function of Pingouin returns the T-value, p-value, degrees of freedom, effect size, 95% confidence interval, statistical power and the Bayes factor of the test.

    I often write about how R programming is the fastest, easiest way for ANY professional to unlock advanced analytics. Seems like Microsoft agrees with me. 😁 Many of my clients are starting to deploy Power BI to professionals that have traditionally used Microsoft Excel for their data work. These clients usually ask about empowering these professionals with analytics - especially predictive analytics. I advise to first get folks trained on Power BI fundamentals - especially construction and analysis of multidimensional histograms, bar charts, and line charts. In other words, get folks comfortable performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Power BI. Then I advise getting these folks training with R. Why? 1 - R programming is easy for Excel users to learn. 2 - Microsoft has heavily invested in R to extend Power BI. I usually get a healthy dose of skepticism regarding point 1. I don't blame folks for that and I don't expect them to take my word for it. If you give me 40 minutes I can prove to you that ANY professional with Excel skills can learn R.

    From Yann LeCunn… Video of a technical talk I gave: "A Path Towards Autonomous AI" Hosted by Baidu on 2022-02-22. TL;DR: - autonomous AI requires predictive world models - world models must be able to perform multimodal predictions - solution: Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) - JEPA makes prediction in representation space, and can choose to ignore irrelevant or hard-to-predict details. - JEPA can be trained non-contrastively by (1) making the representations of inputs maximally informative, (2) making the representations predictable from each other, (3) regularizing latent variables necessary for prediction. - JEPAs can be stacked to make long-term/long-range predictions in more abstract representation spaces. - Hierarchical JEPAs can be used for hierarchical planning.

    If people make something look easy, it's probably not. Does luck play a factor? Sure. But luck isn't a long-term strategy. I work with people who: - Land jobs at top companies - Ace their interviews - Secure high 6-figure salaries (and negotiate for more) - Become top-performers - Get promoted faster than anyone else - Start/run a business - Raise $ These people aren't "winging it" but put in the time and practice to get to where they are. Best part? I know anyone can do it. #careers #jobsearch[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6902975292697038849?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6902975292697038849%29)

    𝗗𝗮𝘆-𝟰𝟭𝟮 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 How Do Vision Transformers Work? by Yonsei University, South Korea Follow me for a similar post: Ashish Patel ------------------------------------------------------------------- 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀 : 🔸This paper is published arxiv2022. 👉 Our present work demonstrates that MSAs are not merely generalized Convs, but rather generalized spatial smoothings that complement Convs. MSAs help NNs learn strong representations by ensem- bling feature map points and flattening the loss landscape. Since the main objective of this work is to investigate the nature of MSA for computer vision, we preserve the architectures of Conv and MSA blocks in AlterNet. Thus, AlterNet has a strong potential for future improvements. ------------------------------------------------------------------- 𝗜𝗠𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗖𝗘 ✔️ The success of multi-head self-attentions (MSAs) for computer vision is now indisputable. However, little is known about how MSAs work. ✔️ We present fundamental explanations to help better understand the nature of MSAs. In particular, we demonstrate the following properties of MSAs and Vision Transformers (ViTs): 💁 (1) MSAs improve not only accuracy but also generalization by flattening the loss landscapes. Such improvement is primarily attributable to their data specificity, not long-range dependency. On the other hand, ViTs suffer from non-convex losses. Large datasets and loss landscape smoothing methods alleviate this problem; 💁 (2) MSAs and Convs exhibit opposite behaviors. For example, MSAs are low-pass filters, but Convs are high-pass filters. Therefore, MSAs and Convs are complementary; 💁 (3) Multi-stage neural networks behave like a series connection of small individual models. In addition, MSAs at the end of a stage play a key role in prediction. Based on these insights, we propose AlterNet, a model in which Conv blocks at the end of a stage are replaced with MSA blocks. AlterNet outperforms CNNs not only in large data regimes but also in small data regimes. #computervision #artificialintelligence #data[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6900496940048494592?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6900496940048494592%29)

    Gradients without Backpropagation Atılım Güneş Baydin, Barak A. Pearlmutter, Don Syme, Frank Wood, Philip Torr University of Oxford Using backpropagation to compute gradients of objective functions for optimization has remained a mainstay of machine learning. Backpropagation, or reverse-mode differentiation, is a special case within the general family of automatic differentiation algorithms that also includes the forward mode. We present a method to compute gradients based solely on the directional derivative that one can compute exactly and efficiently via the forward mode. We call this formulation the forward gradient, an unbiased estimate of the gradient that can be evaluated in a single forward run of the function, entirely eliminating the need for backpropagation in gradient descent. #machinelearning #deeplearning #algorithms #training #gradient https://lnkd.in/eNSX6RxA[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6900326955657293824?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6900326955657293824%29)

    Skills with SQL opens up a new world of possibilities for ANY professional that analyzes data with Microsoft Excel. The combination of Excel and SQL is like chocolate and peanut butter - better together! SQL unlocks the power of the database server for Excel analysts. This has many benefits, including: 1 - Acquiring, cleaning, and transforming data at scale. 2 - Conducting data analyses (e.g., RFM analysis) directly in the DB. 3 - Enhancements to your Power Query data pipelines. For the reasons listed above, and many others, SQL is one of the most valuable (if not THE most valuable) of all data skills. Here's the best part. Learning SQL is easy for Excel users. Don't take it from me, here's some feedback on my tutorial series from Alexander Maisuradze: "Brilliant way to introduce SQL. I had an opportunity to see the Datacamp course and in the first video they start with select from - while you do not even understand from where you are selecting and what. Your approach is excellent, really pedagogical! Thanks" Interested in learning more? Head over to YouTube and search on "David Langer." My YouTube channel is the first search result you get. SQL programming for more powerful data analysis. You've got this if you want it.

    ## CV4ARVR 2022 — XR @ Cornell
    
    VR is more mature than existing AR technology and it has already showed some effective industry use-cases as well, from training (e.g. astronaut training, flight simulators), gaming and real estate applications to tourism, while mobile-driven AR effects such as virtual try-on of makeup, face masks o

    Nicolas Gisin is Professor of Physics, specializing in the foundations of quantum mechanics, at the University of Geneva. PS: I don’t agree with everything Prof Grisin has to say on this subject, but it seems no one agrees with anyone on their ideas (everyone has their own particular position), so that is something to deal with! 😉 LINKS MENTIONED: -Quantum Chance by Nicholas Gisin (affiliate): https://amzn.to/3KPHG8x -Sabine Hossenfelder's Superdeterminism: https://lnkd.in/eSt_5DPp... -James Robert Brown (the philosophy of math professor who introduced Curt to Gisin): https://lnkd.in/eRPBuwS6...

    Two brain cells are sensing each other. And trying to connect: A growth cone is a large extension of a developing or regenerating neurite seeking its synaptic target. Growth cones are situated on the tips of neurites, either dendrites or axons, of the nerve cell. Growth cone receptors detect the presence of axon guidance molecules which can act as an attractant or a repellent, depending on context.

    ✨ Commonsense 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 using 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀? 🎈 Last Monday, researchers from University of Pennsylvania released a paper proposing a new framework to perform 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 (𝗖𝗖𝗥). 🔹 Commonsense causality is tricky. 🔹 Why? First of all, it involves common sense. Common sense is chronically hard to define and may differ from person to person, especially (but not exclusively) between subjects from different sub-populations. 🔹 The authors propose their definition of common sense** and then operationalize it smartly. ** "𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘴𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘤 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘣𝘺 𝘢𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘴" 🔹 The authors leverage the fact that 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 may provide us with some information about causality (precedence does not imply causation, but causation implies precedence). 🔹 𝗧𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 alone is susceptible to 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 though. 🔹 To mitigate potential confoundedness, the authors use 𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴. 🔹 The framework (called 𝗥𝗢𝗖𝗞) consists of four main components, implemented using various techniques, including an excellent open-source 𝗚𝗣𝗧-𝗝 (https://6b.eleuther.ai/) as event sampler***, fine-tuned ROBERTa as a temporal predictor*** and 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝘆𝗝𝘂𝗶𝗰𝗲***/**** (https://lnkd.in/d5yNhsPw) as intervention generator. 🔹 𝗥𝗢𝗖𝗞 outperforms certain benchmarks on COPA dataset, while underperforming others. At the same time it does not require task-specific finetuning and - as the authors conclude - "𝘪𝘴 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘴 𝘢 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘵𝘰𝘵𝘺𝘱𝘦 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘥𝘰𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘢𝘭 𝘪𝘯𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝘧𝘳𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘭 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘵𝘢𝘴𝘬𝘴" 💎 __________________________ *** Please refer to the paper for more details. **** PolyJuice is so exciting!

    DeepMind has done it again, and just released a preprint on #AlphaCode - a code-generation system for competitive programming. They claim it performs at the level of the median human participant, when evaluated on Codeforces competitions (https://codeforces.com/). This are mind-blowing results (🤯) since it is considered to be one of the most challenging tasks for AI these days. "We find that massively scaling up sampling and then filtering and clustering samples to a small set, together with new sampling efficient transformer architectures to support large scale sampling, are essential to achieving good performance."

    🎖 Hugging Face released #ViLT recently - the latest in VLP (Vision Language Pretraining ). The below diagram shows where the new ViLT model fits in the image hierarchy and what tasks you can do with it. 👉There are V+L tasks that are a class-part like NLVR-Natural Language for Visual Reasoning and VQA-Visual Question Answering, Visual Navigation & VCR as they are much more complicated than higher-order tasks like (OCR or Image Captioning) which I call derived or advanced tasks (for lack of a better word) 👉For instance, we could combine Image and Language encoders trained in isolation and add cross-attention to create a generative model to tackle OCR or Image Captioning (That’s exactly what VisionEncoderDecoder class does). 👉But we cannot tackle derived tasks the same way, we need to train image and language data together with image level loss + language level loss + alignment loss. That’s exactly what VLP does for you and ViLT is the latest and greatest in VLP. It has several advantages over its predecessors like UNiTER, VisualBERT and LXMERT etc but they are cumbersome. Read the primers linked below for more details. (The difference between higher-order and derived tasks is even though higher-order tasks are multimodal they don’t necessarily need a VLP model to tackle them) - If you are new to VLP => https://lnkd.in/gaDQEJwd - If you are confusing 🤗 VisionEncDec, VLP and CLIP => https://lnkd.in/gmYsEwHh - If you need help on contrastive learning basics to understand CLIP better => https://lnkd.in/dRvhBuJk - ViLT docs => https://lnkd.in/g4Fd_WhA - Niels, the contributor of this model has made a post with links to examples, check it out. PS: There is an egregious misunderstanding among the general populace - Generating product descriptions from e-com product images is sure as hell NOT image captioning and I wish it was so easy 😅[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6894605212322029568?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6894605212322029568%29)

    A good and gentle material to give an overview of what automated machine learning is, as well as method, system and workflow. AutoML extends beyond just creating novel model architectures, nowadays, its scope covers all aspects of the machine learning workflow that can be potentially automated. Which includes data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, architecture search, hyperparameters optimization, model interpretation and prediction analysis.

    Christian and Marco present a hardware-accelerated #ROS 2 executor with #speedups up to 20x. A ROS 2 #executor uses one or more threads of the underlying #operatingsystem to invoke the callbacks (subscriptions, timers, service servers, service clients) on incoming messages and events. Their novel approach introduces an #FPGA-accelerated event-based #ROS2 executor which schedules callbacks of ROS 2 nodes and utilizes a #reconfigurable slot model and partial runtime reconfiguration to load hardware-based callbacks on demand. Their executor registers ROS 2 node functions as callbacks and dispatches them to run either in #software or in #hardware.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6893837539615350784?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6893837539615350784%29)

    Hey folks, ✔⚡ 🌈 🏆🥇 𝐀 𝐒𝐔𝐑𝐕𝐄𝐘 𝐎𝐅 𝐍𝐄𝐔𝐑𝐀𝐋 𝐀𝐓𝐓𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐌𝐎𝐃𝐄𝐋𝐒 𝐈𝐍 𝐃𝐄𝐄𝐏 𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐑𝐍𝐈𝐍𝐆 🥇🏆🌈⚡✔ by Alana de Santana Correi and Esther Luna Colombini ⚡⚡ Abstract ⚡⚡: ✅ In humans, Attention is a core property of all perceptual and cognitive operations. Given our limited ability to process competing sources, attention mechanisms select, modulate, and focus on the information most relevant to behavior. ✅ For decades, concepts and functions of attention have been studied in philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and computing. For the last six years, this property has been widely explored in deep neural networks. Currently, the state-of-the-art in Deep Learning is represented by neural attention models in several application domains. ✅ This survey provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of developments in neural attention models. We systematically reviewed hundreds of architectures in the area, identifying and discussing those in which attention has shown a significant impact. We also developed and made public an automated methodology to facilitate the development of reviews in the area. ✅ By critically analyzing 650 works, we describe the primary uses of attention in convolutional, recurrent networks and generative models, identifying common subgroups of uses and applications. Furthermore, we describe the impact of attention in different application domains and their impact on neural networks’ interpretability. ✅ Finally, we list possible trends and opportunities for further research, hoping that this review will provide a succinct overview of the main attentional models in the area and guide researchers in developing future approaches that will drive further improvements.

    Hey folks, ✔⚡ 🌈 🏆🥇 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐗𝐆𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 🥇🏆🌈⚡✔ by Stefanos Fafalios, Pavlos Charonyktakis and Ioannis Tsamardinos from Gnosis Data Analysis ⚡⚡ From the abstract ⚡⚡ : Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function. The idea of gradient boosting originated in the observation by Leo Breiman that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function. XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an open-source software library which provides the state-of-the-art gradient boosting framework packaged in many languages, such as C++, Python and Java. It aims to provide a ”Scalable, Portable and Distributed Gradient Boosting Library”. It runs on a single machine, as well as the distributed processing frameworks Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. The scope of this manuscript is to set a background for the gradient boosting algorithms, explain the theoretical subset of the XGBoost framework that has been implemented as a part of the JADBIO framework and compare JADBIO’s implementation to the original. The JADBIO version of gradient boosting, implements a convenient subset of the functionality of the XGBoost framework, and has also been extended to account for the case of survival optimization as well.

    Want to upgrade your SQL skills for an interview or for your job? Here's how I'd break down your time: Common topics (should master these): 1. SELECT and WHERE for filtering and selection 2. COUNT, SUM, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING for aggregating data" 3. DISTINCT, COUNT DISTINCT for producing useful distinct lists and distinct aggregates 4. OUTER (e.g. LEFT) and INNER JOIN when/where to use them 5. Strings and time conversions 6. UNION and UNION ALL. Topics that come up regularly (be familiar with them): 1. DML/DDL/DCL concepts 2. Handling NULLs creatively (e.g. with COALESCE) 3. Subqueries and the impact of subqueries on efficiency of the query 4. Temporary tables 5. Self joins 6. Window functions like PARTITION, LEAD, LAG, NTILE 7. UDFs (user defined functions) 8. Use of indexes in querying to make operations faster. Important, but more rare topics (useful to know): 1. Recursive CTEs 2. Dynamic SQL generation 3. Query optimization 4. Materialized views What would you add, or change? #datascience #data #sql[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6888114680242458624?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6888114680242458624%29)

    Out of several YT videos on vision transformers (ViT), I liked how Shusen Wang explained their mechanics in an immediately understandable way. https://lnkd.in/dbzFgMbt l have to admit it: I'm not a fan of scientific papers. I always feel that I have to comb through too much information when I actually just want to understand the core idea as fast as possible. I haven't found a perfect alternative yet, but YT videos and papers with code are certainly helping. Vision transformers have established themselves as an alternative to CNNs, it's a close race atm - ViTs tend to require high amounts of data though. #deeplearning #ai #autonomousdriving[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6888100601318645760?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6888100601318645760%29)

    Did you know that 𝐀𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 (𝐈𝐒𝐋𝐑) book has an online course? 🎥 🌈❤️ 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭? I consider the 𝐈𝐒𝐋𝐑 as one of the best resources for learning machine learning. The book focuses on core concepts of ML, from basic linear regression to deep learning models, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning. Edx is offering an online course by Stanford University, following the book curriculum. The course instructors are two of the book authors - Prof. Trevor Hastie and Prof. Rob Tibshirani. While the book is based on #R some awesome people translate it to #python, #julialang, and other R flavors (see links on the comments below 👇🏼). Both the book and the course are available for 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 (links below)! ❤️ The course covers the following topics: Overview of statistical learning Linear regression Classification Resampling methods Linear model selection and regularization Moving beyond linearity Tree-based methods Support vector machines Deep learning Survival modeling Unsupervised learning Multiple testing 𝐖𝐡𝐨? I think the ISRL is a great resource for students who want to get into data science and machine learning and folks that are transitioning to data science from other domains. I personally use it as a reference whenever I want to dive into a specific topic.

We will discuss what they are, what the limitations are, the typical use cases, and we will look at some examples. We will start with a general introduction to autoencoders, and we will discuss the role of the activation function in the output layer and the loss function. We will then discuss what the reconstruction error is. Finally, we will look at typical applications as dimensionality reduction, classification, denoising, and anomaly detection is.

    [🧠 AI history 🧠] Strongly recommend watching this video! Some of the historical facts, quite honestly, surprised me. And if you're new here hopefully you know who Juergen is! (hint: same club as Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton) It's sad that sometimes the academic accolades are more a consequence of good networking rather than of important academic contributions. The story is definitely very nuanced and has spurred a lot of debate in the community (although not nearly enough, IMHO). Should we be celebrating DanNet even more than AlexNet? Or at least pay it more tribute? Are GANs and ResNets a "simple special case" of prior work? Let me know your opinions, and check out my YouTube comment for more thoughts! #history #ai[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6885313928100892672?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6885313928100892672%29)

    “Taught by DeepMind researchers, this series was created in collaboration with University College London (UCL) to offer students a comprehensive introduction to modern reinforcement learning. Comprising 13 lectures, the series covers the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and planning in sequential decision problems, before progressing to more advanced topics and modern deep RL algorithms. It gives students a detailed understanding of various topics, including Markov Decision Processes, sample-based learning algorithms (e.g. (double) Q-learning, SARSA), deep reinforcement learning, and more. It also explores more advanced topics like off-policy learning, multi-step updates and eligibility traces, as well as conceptual and practical considerations in implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as rainbow DQN.”[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6880954257651068928?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6880954257651068928%29)

    Hey folks, ✩░▒▓▆ 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨 𝐭𝐨 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭 𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐋𝐢𝐬𝐭 ▆▓▒░✩ These courses, lectures, and books by Ahmed Bahaa Eldin are aimed at those looking to become a Research Scientist focused on deep learning and NLP. Coding skills and computer science knowledge are the only prerequisites. A range of MATH courses from an INTRODUCTORY level to an ADVANCED level are included in this list, such as linear algebra, calculus, probability/statistics, and optimization theory. There are also a variety of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning courses and lectures (depending on the level of background). This list of resources is really COMPREHENSIVE and I believe that anyone interested in acquiring or strengthening their understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning can find something useful here.

    Hey folks, 🔥 🔥 𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐈𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍, 𝐑𝐄𝐂𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐒𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐄 𝐢𝐬 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐄𝐍𝐎𝐔𝐆𝐇 🔥 🔥 Performance metrics like PRECISION, RECALL, and FSCORE are commonly used for classification models A PRECISION is the percentage of correctly identified POSITIVEs: PRECISION = True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives) = TP/(TP+FP) RECALL refers to the number of actual POSITIVES that have been correctly identified: RECALL = TP/(TP + False Negatives(FN)) FScore (and its weighted variant F_beta score) combines PRECISION and RECALL and equal to their harmonic mean: FSCORE = 2* PRECISION*RECALL/(PRECISION + RECALL) Well, the precision-recall curve (or FScore) seems to be a powerful metric for measuring model performance There is a catch, though! It is noteworthy that TRUE NEGATIVES do not appear in the F-SCORE definition. As a result, the model performance of the NEGATIVE CLASS is TOTALLY IGNORED It can be acceptable in many scenarios, including anomaly detection In case you care about NEGATIVE CLASS performance, use the following metrics: - Balanced Accuracy - Matthew's Correlation Coefficient - Cohen's Kappa(close to F1 for high TN) which are taking NEGATIVE CLASS performance into account For more info see links in the COMMENTS ENJOY, LEARN & KEEP IMPROVING! 🍓 🍒 𝕱𝖔𝖑𝖑𝖔𝖜 Michael(Mike) Erlihson, PhD for awesome DS/ML/math resources 🍓 🍒 #modelperformance #machinelearning #datascience #accuracy #metrics[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6876058056111730689?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6876058056111730689%29)

    Freezing during interviews is a career-long problem for me. My issue is my brain is working on too many possible choices based on ambiguous input. When I work on a real problem it's possible for me to take time to cull the search space in an orderly fashion, but when you know you only have 45 minutes you have to just pick one and hope -- if you pick the wrong one, and the interviewer isn't skilled, it becomes a negative feedback loop. I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who thinks they "know" me after 45 minutes of an often poorly planned social experiment.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6871493704205660161?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6871493704205660161%29)

    Need a dataset for multi-agent (cooperative) perception in driving applications? I'm happy to announce the Cooperative Driving Dataset (CODD)! This dataset includes lidar data from multiple vehicles navigating simultaneously through a diverse set of driving scenarios and was created to enable further research in cooperative 3D object detection, multi-agent SLAM and point cloud registration. The dataset was generated using CARLA and provides 108 sequences (125 frames each) across all 10 available maps, ranging from small rural areas to dense urban zones. The sequences have, on average, 10 vehicles, all of which provide synchronised point clouds. The ground-truth 3D bounding box annotations are also provided for all vehicles and pedestrians, along with the absolute pose of each lidar sensor at each timestep. We also provide the source-code used to generate the dataset, allowing users to customise the simulation settings and sensor configurations to create their own version of the dataset. For more details, please see the links below.

    بعد از فیدبک‌های مثبتی که از انتشار جزوه دوره ماشین لرنینگ دکتر سلیمانی از دانشگاه شریف گرفتم، تصمیم گرفتم حرکت مشابهی رو برای موضوعات مختلف جبر خطی، که به نحوی جزو مباحث پایه‌ای در یادگیری ماشین به حساب میاد، بزنم. محتوای متنی نوشته شده بر اساس ویدیوهای پلی لیست Essence of Linear Algebra از کانال یوتیوب 3blue1brown هست. . دلیلی که باعث شد این مجموعه رو انتخاب کنم این بود که دید خودم رو نسبت به مفاهیم مختلفی که در جبر خطی وجود داره تغییر داد و باعث شد شهود هندسی خیلی خوبی نسبت به مفاهیم مختلف به ‌دست بیارم که نه در دبیرستان و نه در دانشگاه، در هیچ کلاس درسی بهشون اشاره نشده بود. . در کل، امیدوارم مفید باشه و به درد کسی بخوره. در ضمن، اگر جایی در مورد محتوای منتشرشده توسط من، ایرادی هست، ممنون میشم ترجیحاً در قالب کامنت در پلتفرم ویرگول، در زیر جلسه مربوطه، بهم فیدبک بدین که راحت‌تر بتونم اصلاح کنم. همچنین، لازم به ذکره که در ابتدا و انتهای هر جلسه به صورت جدا، به منبع و مرجع اصلی لینک داده شده است. . لیست جلسات: جلسه اول - بردارها (Vectors): https://vrgl.ir/vIxQo جلسه دوم - ترکیب خطی، Span و بردارهای پایه: https://vrgl.ir/Jtyda جلسه سوم - تبدیل خطی و ماتریس‌ها: https://vrgl.ir/FMYpX جلسه چهارم - مفهوم ضرب ماتریس‌ها: https://vrgl.ir/3BdAp جلسه پنجم - تبدیل خطی در فضای سه‌ بعدی: https://vrgl.ir/NCJGl جلسه ششم – دترمینان: https://vrgl.ir/cKdlJ جلسه هفتم - ماتریس معکوس، رنک ماتریس، Column Space، Null Space: https://vrgl.ir/AaEdx جلسه هشتم - ماتریس غیر مربعی: https://vrgl.ir/QNrD2 جلسه نهم - مفهوم ضرب داخلی: https://vrgl.ir/3uzc7 جلسه دهم - مفهوم ضرب خارجی: https://vrgl.ir/eXDIU جلسه یازدهم - رابطه ضرب خارجی و تبدیل خطی: https://vrgl.ir/oYXJp جلسه دوازدهم - شهود هندسی روش کرامر: https://vrgl.ir/AlPz2 جلسه سیزدهم - تغییر بردارهای پایه: https://vrgl.ir/lZJEl جلسه چهاردهم - مفهوم مقدار و بردار ویژه: https://vrgl.ir/n5Ufp جلسه پانزدهم - روشی سریع برای محاسبه مقادیر ویژه: https://vrgl.ir/daMIq جلسه شانزدهم - فضای برداری انتزاعی: https://vrgl.ir/2DIUO . پلی‌لیست: https://lnkd.in/emXnYHNT کانال: https://lnkd.in/eGbNrQy5[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6870619538635980800?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6870619538635980800%29)

    Check out this Data Science Course for Beginners! According to US Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for Data Science jobs will increase by 11.5 Millions by 2026. So hirers will need all the supply they can get. The Data Science field has no rigid rules in how to make a career out of it. You just have to get started. We’re lucky that people like Nitya Narasimhan, PhD can find time to curate such elaborate doc to get anyone to take the first steps with DS. Hope you enjoy this one new students! Please note that learning the basics is fundamental, and the more specialized you need to be (like a research scientist), the better it is to go to academia. #datascience #machinelearning #artificialintelligence Click #linkedangle and follow for more content Follow Greg Coquillo[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6868959313717694465?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6868959313717694465%29)

    Hey folks, The DATA SCIENCE DESIGN MANUAL - FREE BOOK by Steven S. Skiena "This engaging and clearly written textbook/reference provides a must-have introduction to the rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field of data science. It focuses on the principles fundamental to becoming a good data scientist and the key skills needed to build systems for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. The Data Science Design Manual is a source of practical insights that highlights what really matters in analyzing data, and provides an intuitive understanding of how these core concepts can be used. The book does not emphasize any particular programming language or suite of data-analysis tools, focusing instead on high-level discussion of important design principles. This easy-to-read text ideally serves the needs of undergraduate and early graduate students embarking on an "Introduction to Data Science" course. It reveals how this discipline sits at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and machine learning, with a distinct heft and character of its own. Practitioners in these and related fields will find this book perfect for self-study as well." LINK for BOOK DOWNLOAD: https://lnkd.in/ddeVCkMN ENJOY, LEARN and KEEP IMPROVING!!

    Hey folks, GRAND MACHINE LEARNING CHEAT SHEET: One of the best " ... This cheat sheet is a condensed version of MACHINE LEARNING manual, which contains many classical equations and diagrams on machine learning, and aims to help you quickly recall knowledge and ideas in machine learning. It has two significant advantages: 1. Clearer symbols. Mathematical formulas use quite a lot of confusing symbols. For example, X can be a set, a random variable, or a matrix. This is very confusing and makes it very difficult for readers to understand the meaning of math formulas. This cheat sheet tries to standardize the usage of symbols, and all symbols are clearly pre-defined, see section 2. Less thinking jumps. In many machine learning books, authors omit some intermediary steps of a mathematical proof process, which may save some space but causes difficulty for readers to understand this formula and readers get lost in the middle way of the derivation process. This cheat sheet tries to keep important intermediary steps as where as possible..." ENJOY, LEARN and KEEP IMPROVING!

    Hey folks, Basic DATA CLEANING: Ultimate Guide - FREE BOOK by Atlan From the book intro: "Before you begin analyzing your data, it is crucial to ensure that your data set is complete and correct. The data cleaning process helps you achieve this by detecting and removing errors and inconsistencies in your data. But what if you can’t wait to get your hands on the data and start analyzing it? Can you skip the data cleaning process? The answer is NO. In fact, the more you care about data analysis, the more you should care about data cleaning. After all, you don’t want to be making important decisions based on wrong insights simply because your data had errors!".... Credit 4Sharing: Data Science Dojo (thanks!!)

    Hey folks, FREE BOOK: DATA INVESTIGATION- EDA the Right Way by Vivek Chaudhary, Anirudh Dayma, John Gabriel and Manvendra Singh EDA is a methodology used by data scientists/analysts to analyze, investigate, and summarize data sets in order to summarize their main characteristics, often by using data visualization techniques. Data scientists can use EDA to find patterns, find anomalies, test hypotheses, test assumptions or get answers from large data sources. The REASON behind writing this book (from the preface): ... There are many reasons. But to keep it simple, this book is not going to start defining "What is Data Cleaning? How to present the same in the visuals"? But rather, we are going to follow a unique way, where we'll handle EDA domain wise, step by step in a simplified way.

    LinkedIn: I’m breaking down step-by-step the #resume that I had after having my first job at Snap Inc. I promise you it’ll help you in your #JobSearch, so feel free to share with those who are also on the journey (And get the template here: https://bit.ly/3DekY5U). Let’s break it down👇 💡Red = Action Verbs: I start each experience with an action verb; if it’s in a current position, you can put as present and if past, you put as -Ed (Example of great action verbs: Collaborated, managed, improved) 💡Orange = Hard Skills: I put the specific hard skills and platform based skills throughout my resume to show that I fit the job description's qualifications; at the bottom, I also have the skills and match them to my experiences where applicable which you can do for your own resume. (Example: I was going into Strategy / Operations so I put relevant skills pertaining to the industry) 💡Not colored, but at the top = Education: put where you graduated, gpa if over a 3.5, organizations/awards, etc. IMO Relevant coursework is optional; you can add this if you don't have relevant experience (yet) or are working on gaining those experiences. Header: Location as (City, State), LinkedIn (linked), phone number, and email (Optional: Portfolio/Personal Website) 💡Green = impact metrics: these are numbers and percentages from the positions I worked in and showcase what I did to impact the company. How did I get these numbers either through a) asking my peers/managers b) calculated estimations based on observations 💡Cyan = Impact statements before the number/percentages: This showcases if I improved, optimized, or increased xyz which is related to Operations role lingo 💡Yellow = soft skills: more broad or simple statements, these are relative to collaboration, providing recommendations, and identifying solutions to potential problems If you have any questions, feel free to leave them below and follow for more breakdowns👀💡 EDIT: Attached the resume template above with free resources if anyone needs it! #JWoW #Wonsulting[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6848632858454695936?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6848632858454695936%29)

    Hey folks, CHATBOT PRINCIPLES EXPLAINED by #neuronai and #inblog A chatbot is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to replicate human conversations. They're also referred to as "digital assistants" that are aware of human capabilities. Bots decipher the user's purpose, process their requests, and respond quickly with appropriate information. Bots can speak via voice and text, and they can be used on websites, apps, and messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Want to know more? Check out the attached slideset!

    Hey folks, FREE BOOK on Data Science (Mining): A Programmer’s Guide to Data Mining by Ron Zacharski From the Author: This book follows a learn-by-doing approach. Instead of passively reading the book, I encourage you to work through the exercises and experiment with the Python code I provide. Experimenting around, code hacking, and trying out methods with different data sets is the key to really gaining an understanding for the techniques. I try to strike a balance between hands-on, nuts-and-bolts discussion of Python data mining code that you can use and modify, and the theory behind the data mining techniques. To try to prevent the brain freeze associated with reading theory, math, and Python code, I tried to stimulate a different part of your brain by adding drawings and pictures.

    Natural language processing (NLP) This is the 30th day of 40 days of AI and we are covering the Next Big Breakthrough in AI according to Harvard Business Review. In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved phenomenal success in linguistic and semantic tasks like text classification, machine translation, cognitive dialogue systems, information retrieval via Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). This feat is primarily attributed due to the seminal Transformer architecture, leading to designs such as BERT, GPT (I, II, III), etc. Although these large-size models have achieved unprecedented performances, they come at high computational costs. Consequently, some of the recent NLP architectures have utilized concepts of transfer learning, pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to achieve moderate model sizes while keeping nearly similar performances as achieved by their predecessors. The NLP Cookbook: Totally recommended if you are into modern NLP: https://lnkd.in/gY6T6Fn These are top NLP courses on youtube: CMU Neural Networks for NLP: To learn the latest neural network-based techniques for NLP: • Language Modeling • Efficiency tricks • Conditioned Generation • Structured Prediction • Model Interpretation • Advanced Search Algorithms ... https://lnkd.in/gXHQ3ub Multilingual NLP: To learn the latest concepts for doing multilingual NLP: • Typology • Words, Part of Speech, and Morphology • Advanced Text Classification • Machine Translation • Data Augmentation for MT • Low Resource ASR • Active Learning ... https://lnkd.in/gAtqkm2 Advanced NLP: To learn advanced concepts in NLP: • Attention Mechanisms • Transformers • BERT • Question Answering • Model Distillation • Vision + Language • Ethics in NLP • Commonsense Reasoning ... https://lnkd.in/ggpQAD6 ✔I have recently started the "40 days of AI", I share some resources, tutorials, and books from beginner to intermediate.

    If you want the decision-makers to understand the ethical issues of facial recognition, you need to turn the table! 'The Flemish Scrollers' is software automatically tagging distracted Belgian politicians when they use their phone on the daily live streams. Every meeting of the Flemish government in Belgium is live-streamed on a YouTube channel. When a Livestream starts the software is searching for phones and tries to identify a distracted politician. This is done with the help of AI and face recognition. ✔I have recently started the "40 days of AI", I share some resources, tutorials, and books from beginner to intermediate.

    #ROS nodes on a #Chip. Without being a hardware expert, #ReconROS allows ROS 2 developers to create #ROS2 hardware nodes and accelerate parts of their code in an #FPGA. Still today, optimizing dataflow pipelines for #robotics applications by porting software to hardware requires complex know-how and the creation of suitable interfaces between host software and the FPGA. Christian Lienen, Marco Platzner and Bernhard Rinner tackle this problem and propose a novel approach that enables #roboticists to leverage the performance and #energy-efficiency of FPGAs while demonstrating it in three aplications (inverse kinematics, number sorting and a sobel filter) where they #accelerate computations up to 6 times their initial CPU baselines. With this, you can now build ROS-specific circuitry for your robot application.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6812811601008185344?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6812811601008185344%29)

    Hey folks, EXCELLENT TRANSFORMER SURVEY PAPER Transformer is a deep learning architecture that employ attention, by weighing the effect of different parts of input data Transformer models are gaining in popularity around the world, hundreds of articles offering variants of the transformers have been released, and the pace is not slowing down. There are so many transformers it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with them all - so this article can act as a lifeline. An impressive number of transformer types is described, as well as a taxonomy of the various transformers. Definitely worth reading - https://lnkd.in/dFur9TA Finally my two cents about transformers - feel free to take a look at the reviews of the transformer models I made as part of #deepnightlearners: HEBREW: 1. https://lnkd.in/d6QVw2D 2. https://lnkd.in/dsr8CN3 3. https://lnkd.in/dff-TSK 4. https://lnkd.in/dzn4abr ENGLISH: 1. https://lnkd.in/dHqMPEA 2. https://lnkd.in/dXX45ha Follow Michael(Mike) Erlihson for awesome DS materials #datascience #machinelearning #transformers #transformer #scientificpaper #reviews #taxonomy #deeplearning #deepneuralnetworks[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6810542072378990592?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6810542072378990592%29)

    Hey folks, 3 DATA SCIENCE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS RESOURCES (merged in a SINGLE DOC) DATA SCIENCE is all about DATA. DATA SCIENCE(DS) pertains to scientific methods, procedures, and models designed to get insights from data and make decisions, based on this understanding. As DS encompasses a wide variety of topics, disciplines, and approaches, an interviewer's question can still surprise even an experienced Data Scientist. Attached are 3 resources (in a single FILE), containing really #impressive number of common DS interview questions (part of them come with answers). I hope that these resources will help you to prepare to your next DS interview Credit: to Carl Shan, Max Song, Henry Wang and William Chen, Steve Nouri and Data-Driven Science ENJOY, LEARN and KEEP IMPROVING!!

    Hey folks, FREQUENTIST vs BAYESIAN STATISTICS: THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION + BONUS(UNRELATED) : HOW TO BUILD CAREER IN DATA SCIENCE BOOK Frequentist and Bayesian are types of INFERENTIAL STATISTICS TECHNIQUES. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS: Draw a conclusion about ENTIRE GROUP based ONLY on a SAMPLE FROM this group. COIN-SIMPLE EXPLANATION: Imagine that you’ve thrown a COIN, but you can’t see which side it fell on. FREQUENTIST: I don’t know anything about the probability of HEAD/ TAIL. GIVEN the coin heads up, the HEAD PROBABILITY is 1and TAIL PROBABILITY is 0; GIVEN the coin lands TAIL UP, TAIL PROBABILITY is 1 and HEAD PROBABILITY is 0. BAYESIAN: TAIL and HEAD PROBABILITies have CLOSE VALUES (about 1/2) What is the DIFFERENCE? FREQUENTIST: We know nothing about QUANTITY of INTEREST(parameter), before we do some experiments, from which we can estimate this parameter. But if we throw a coin 10000 times and get 5098 heads, then HEAD PROBABILITY is close to 0.5. FREQUENTIST: Probabilities are fundamentally related to EVENT FREQUENCIES BAYESIAN: We know SOMETHING about a parameter before carrying out a single experiment on it. What do we know? PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION of this parameter!! Experiments just HELP to make this DISTRIBUTION more “close to reality” BAYESIAN: Probabilities are fundamentally based our own KNOWLEDGE about an event FREQUENTIST: Parameter to be estimated is DETERMINISTIC, has some DETERMINISTIC value, we want to estimate. The parameter estimation UNCERTAINTY can be assessed, for example, based on the assumptions of the sample/population distribution. BAYESIAN: Parameter, we are estimating, is RANDOM, No ONE RIGHT ANSWER for the parameter, has an UNCERTAINTY BUILD-IN ENJOY, LEARN and KEEP IMPROVING!!

    Hey folks, STATISTICAL LEARNING with SPARSITY: The Lasso and Generalizations: Book of #legendary Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Martin Wainwright!! This book summarizes a very interesting field of STATISTICAL LEARNING with SPARSITY. ... A SPARSE STATISTICAL MODEL is one having only a small number of nonzero parameters or weights. It represents a classic case of “less is more”: a sparse model can be much easier to estimate and interpret than a dense model. In this age of #bigdata, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large, and might be larger than the number of observations. The sparsity assumption allows us to tackle such problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets ... Link to the FULL BOOK version is in the comment!

    Check out our new work on "Autonomous Overtaking in Gran Turismo Sport Using Curriculum Reinforcement Learning"! Our end-to-end trained AI agent outperforms built-in AI and matches human expert drivers! In collaboration with Sony AI Zurich. Paper: https://lnkd.in/d9edKH3 Video: https://lnkd.in/d6eDg_u Professional racecar drivers can execute extreme overtaking maneuvers. However, conventional systems for autonomous overtaking rely on either simplified assumptions about the vehicle dynamics or solving expensive trajectory optimization problems online. We propose a learning-based method to tackle the autonomous overtaking problem. By leveraging curriculum learning, our approach leads to faster convergence as well as increased performance compared to "vanilla" reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach using Gran Turismo Sport, a world-leading car racing simulator known for its detailed dynamic modeling of various cars and tracks. As a result, the trained controller outperforms the built-in model-based game AI and achieves comparable overtaking performance with an experienced human driver.

    Ultimate Guide to Effective Data Collection Data has become fundamental in nearly every aspect of life. Organisations use data to make better decisions, increase profits, grow revenues and improve efficiency. However, unless it is automated through algorithms or engagement scores, many components of customer data can still only be collected through well executed surveys, through qualitative and quantitative methods. This resource is designed to help data, product and customer facing professionals design surveys and implement the right processes to output high-quality data. In particular, it runs through survey design, data collection methods, qualitative and quantitative research, question types, best practices, frameworks, population samples, as well as extra tips in pilots and censuses.

    Proud to share our 150-page "proto-book" with Michael Bronstein, Joan Bruna and Taco Cohen on geometric deep learning! https://lnkd.in/d9SCkMv Through the lens of symmetries, invariances and group theory, we attempt to distill "all you need to build the neural architectures that are all you need". All the 'usual suspects' such as CNNs, GNNs, Transformers and LSTMs are covered, while also including recent exciting developments such as Spherical CNNs, SO(3)-Transformers and Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs. Hence we believe that our work can be a useful way to navigate the increasingly challenging landscape of deep learning architectures. arXiv (and other goodies, blogs and talks) coming soon! Our work is very much a work-in-progress, and we welcome any and all feedback![…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6793268667565015040?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6793268667565015040%29)

    The most "devil-is-in-the-details" #MachineLearning subfield is Computer Vision. Let me demonstrate this with the simplest example I could come up with: Resizing an Image Here. I simply resize an image with most popular Python CV libraries: PIL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV NONE of them gives the same result (play with my Colab notebook yourself ⬇️)! And No, small differences matter a lot actually (Parmar et al., 2021). - Do not assume anything. - Always visualize the data at every step. Utilize your biological vision but do not count on it. - Implement tests. Tests of what you expect at every step. - Be cautious when migrating from one framework to another (e.g. TensorFlow to PyTorch). - Study good old signal processing (Fourier Transform, anti-aliasing, wavelets etc.). - Remember that saying "I know this" is a dangerous thing. It is pretty much impossible to learn something that you think you already know.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6792713960165539840?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6792713960165539840%29)

    A new open-source torque-controlled legged robot system, with a low-cost and low-complexity actuator module at its core. It consists of a high-torque brushless DC motor and a low-gear-ratio transmission suitable for impedance and force control. A 2.2 kg quadruped robot with a large range of motion is assembled from eight identical actuator modules and four lower legs with foot contact sensors. Leveraging standard plastic 3D printing and off-the-shelf parts results in a lightweight and inexpensive robot.

    A toolkit for AI-Based Document Analysis Layout parser is a unified python library that helps with turning documents/Images into a semi-structured dataset. Going through all of the old documents, especially the scanned versions will be a nightmare without a good parser.

    The #Exopulse Mollii Suit can improve #mobility for people affected by a #stroke or #Parkinson’s disease. The single-piece suit is equipped with 58 #imbedded #electrodes, which professionals adjust to the user’s individual needs via a control unit. The low-frequency #electrostimulation improves blood circulation and restores the previously inhibited balance between muscles pairs. If, for example, the bicep is tensed, the suit stimulates the tricep, which in turn causes the bicep to relax. As such, the technology works in a complementary way to functional electrical stimulation (FES), in which nerves are stimulated with small electrical impulses in order to trigger movements. by Ottobock market leader in technical #orthopaedics[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6788398649350094848?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6788398649350094848%29)

    #Robots are networks of networks exchanging information in a time-sensitive manner. #FPGAs have unmatched #realtime capabilities and arguably, are the best compute substrate for #roboticists and robotic applications. Zishen, Bo, Thomas, Jie, Yuhao, Yu, Arijit and Shaoshan write about this and believe that #FPGAs are the best compute substrate for robotic applications for several reasons: #First, robotic algorithms are still evolving rapidly, and thus any ASIC-based accelerators will be months or even years behind the state-of-the-art algorithms; on the other hand, FPGAs can be dynamically updated as needed. #Second, robotic workloads are highly diverse, thus it is difficult for any ASIC-based robotic computing accelerator to reach economies of scale in the near future; on the other hand, FPGAs are a cost-effective and energy-effective alternative before one type ofaccelerator reaches economies of scale. #Third, compared to SoCs that have reached economies of scale, e.g., mobile SoCs, FPGAs deliver a significant performance advantage. #Fourth, partial reconfiguration allows multiple robotic workloads to time-share an FPGA, thus allowing one chip to serve multiple applications, leading to overall cost and energy reduction.

    Check out our #CVPR2021 work on making NMS mathematically differentiable. GrooMeD-NMS: Grouped Mathematically Differentiable NMS for Monocular 3D Object Detection Joint work with Garrick Brazil and Xiaoming Liu (MSU) Project: https://lnkd.in/eSkAra8 Paper: https://lnkd.in/eUWxncU Code and Models: https://lnkd.in/eXMrfWK Demo: https://lnkd.in/ezk2jp3 Modern 3D object detectors have immensely benefited from the end-to-end learning idea. However, most of them use a post-processing algorithm called Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) only during inference. In this paper, we present and integrate GrooMeD-NMS -- a novel Grouped Mathematically Differentiable NMS for monocular 3D object detection, such that the network is trained end-to-end with a loss on the boxes after NMS. We first formulate NMS as a matrix operation and then group and mask the boxes in an unsupervised manner to obtain a simple closed-form expression of the NMS. GrooMeD-NMS addresses the mismatch between training and inference pipelines and, therefore, forces the network to select the best 3D box in a differentiable manner. As a result, GrooMeD-NMS achieves state-of-the-art monocular 3D object detection results on the KITTI dataset.[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6786321683381841920?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6786321683381841920%29)

    As a multidisciplinary field, the Probability knowledge is one of the self-explanatory bedrocks for machine learning. Classification models must predict the probability of class membership. Algorithms are designed using probability (e.g. Naive Bayes). Learning algorithms will make decisions using probability (e.g. information gain).

    Recently, I spent some time on reading books/papers about visual SLAM. The difficult part for me is about Lie theory (very important in modern estimation algorithms for robotics). The visual SLAM book I recommended before only gives some intuitive explanations and lists some important results. To get better understanding of this theory, I tried to look for better materials on this topic. Unfortunately, most of the literature on Lie theory is too abstract to learn. Finally, I got this short, dense, and engineer-friendly paper (full of equations): "A micro Lie theory for state estimation in robotics " https://lnkd.in/eRBFMBc. The authors implement a C++11 Lie theory library, called manif, based on the paper: https://lnkd.in/eJD_Q-F. They also create a cheat sheet here: https://lnkd.in/eZFKxy9. Hope these can help others to grasp the useful part of the theory quickly. #visualslam #slam #liegroup #liealgebra #stateestimation #computervision #optimization #poseestimation[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6781567303600394241?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6781567303600394241%29)

    OpenCV DNN module is one of the most popular OpenCV modules which allows running pre-trained neural networks. One of the module’s main drawbacks is its limited CPU-only inference use since it was the only supported mode. Starting from OpenCV version 4.2, the DNN module supports NVIDIA GPU usage, which means acceleration of CUDA and cuDNN when running deep learning networks on it. This blog post will cover the steps for compiling the OpenCV library with DNN GPU support to speed up the neural network inference. https://lnkd.in/gcPGwHm #AI #ComputerVision #ML #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #OpenCV #DL #DeepLearning #deeplearningai[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6771857689279651840?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6771857689279651840%29)

    The recording of my talk on Theoretical Foundations of Graph Neural Networks is now live (+ slides are in the description)! 🕸️ Join me as I derive GNNs from first principles, motivate their use across the sciences, and explain how they emerged, in parallel, along several research lines. This represents a 'convergence' of the ~4 years I've spent studying GNNs. I taught GNNs in many ways over the years, and I feel like I have finally found, imho, the most 'natural' way to introduce them. Thanks again Joan Bruna Michael Bronstein Taco Cohen for the amazing insights! Major thanks are also due to the 500+ people who showed up for the Zoom session, and Ben Day for chairing a very insightful Q&A session! I've received so many emails in support of the talk and it's been wonderful to read your thoughts and discuss further with all of you!

    The existing literature surveys on Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) have various limitations in terms of scope and broadness. Also most of the existing surveys focus on a specific research line within DMPs or focus on publications of specific research group/s. Therefore, this review provides the first significant contribution to a complete overview with unified formulations of numerous DMP methods and applications.

    Hi everyone, You might have experienced hearing "keep it short" when you send your CV to a colleague/friend for review. But, you find it impossible to exclude your achievements. So, you might think of a fast way to change the style to cut a few pages while keeping/adding more to your CV. In my case, it was 4 page CV, and now it is just two. Besides, you might have a hard time selecting a suitable style. To address these, I have tried to gather a list of unique latex templates to select and rebuild your CV as fast as possible ... I hope you find it useful. https://lnkd.in/e_c7hkB #cv #resume #jobs #latex[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6742947726163546112?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6742947726163546112%29)

What is hype, what is anti-hype, and what are some good resources for understanding the GPT-3? Followed by a deep dive of the paper. Enjoy!

    In a new pair of papers, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) came up with new tools to let robots better perceive what they’re interacting with: the ability to see and classify items, and a softer, delicate touch. “We wish to enable seeing the world by feeling the world. Soft robot hands have sensorized skins that allow them to pick up a range of objects, from delicate, such as potato chips, to heavy, such as milk bottles,” says CSAIL Director Daniela Rus Full article: https://lnkd.in/dAwVwBK #technology #engineering #robotics […see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6673288866612436992?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6673288866612436992%29)

    Playlist for my Advanced Dynamics course. Topics covered include Hamiltonian systems, nonlinear dynamics, integrals of motion, periodic orbits, quasi-periodic orbits, resonance, nonlinear oscillators, stability, invariant manifolds, chaos, and symbolic dynamics Playlist https://lnkd.in/eb9Vtag This course gives the student advanced theoretical and semi-analytical tools for analysis of dynamical systems, particularly #mechanical systems (e.g., particles, rigid bodies, continuum systems). We discuss methods for writing equations of motion and the mathematical structure they represent at a more sophisticated level than previous #engineering #dynamics courses. We consider sets of possible motion of mechanical systems (phase space trajectories) which leads to topics of Hamiltonian systems, #nonlinear dynamics, driven nonlinear oscillators, resonance, stability / instability, invariant manifolds, chaos, Poisson brackets, basins of attraction, etc. The class notes in OneNote form: https://lnkd.in/etWcnsH or in PDF form: https://lnkd.in/epDtYbp The videos start halfway through the course (due to the Covid-19 pandemic) but the lecture notes are complete #aerospace #mechanics #mathematics[…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6668851738461691904?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6668851738461691904%29)

    One request we received from the community on the Waymo Open Dataset Challenges is to provide baseline object detections so participants can work on the Tracking Challenges without needing to focus on detection. So we have released baseline 2D and 3D object detections for use in the 2D and 3D Tracking Challenges! These detections were generated by well tuned baseline methods, such as PointPillars and FasterRCNN. You can find more details on these generated boxes on the 2D Tracking and 3D Tracking Challenge pages. We look forward to seeing all that you accomplish![…see more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6659128809956220928?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6659128809956220928%29)
