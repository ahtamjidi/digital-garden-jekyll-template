I have been using leetcode for a while now, there are a few really good leetcode plugins that will help you accelerate your leetcode journey.  
  
1) LeetHub - Integrates your code with Leetcode and Github.  
  
Basically what it does is, whenever you submit your code on leetcode it will take the code and post it in your GitHub repo. This way you can keep a record of questions you solved and the approach you followed.  
  
This makes your Github profile more presentable as it helps show your problem-solving status.  
  
2) Leet Repeat - Spaced repetition of selected problems which helps you revise some key problems regularly. This helps in solution retention via repetition.  
  
This idea is explained by an algorithm called Spaced Repetition which has been implemented in this extension with a fair deal of flexibility where the user can select the repetition timeframe of the problem to be reviewed and the extension will show a comprehensive list of problems to be reviewed each day  
  
3) InterviewBit - The common problems on [#Interviewbit](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=interviewbit&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6879998961189490688) platform as well as on leetcode and [#geeksforgeeks](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=geeksforgeeks&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6879998961189490688) are marked and their direct links are provided. This is super helpful to those who are accustomed to the leetcode platform for DSA.  
  
4) Leetcode Enhancer  
It is a light-weight browser extension which boosts your productivity by hiding unnecessary visual elements from the screen, enabling you to focus on what is important. You can change your preferences form the popup menu and find out what best suits your needs.  
  
Give it a like if you made it so far.
