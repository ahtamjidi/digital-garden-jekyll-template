Dear fellow Californian,
We have more licensed drivers and registered vehicles than any other
state. That means California’s roads pose unique challenges for drivers,
cyclists and pedestrians. But when we follow the rules of the road and
drive with safety in mind at all times, everyone benefits.
That is why this California Driver Handbook is so important. Within
these pages – and online at DMV.ca.gov – you will find information
and advice to safely travel the roads of our great state. Whether you are
a young driver going over this material for the first time or refreshing
your knowledge after years of on-the-road experience, I hope you find the
contents informative, helpful, and practical.
Yes, California’s traveling environment poses unique challenges – from
the coasts to the mountains and everywhere in between. While we may
encounter varying conditions as we move throughout the state, the laws
on how to reach our destination safely do not.
Please be safe when you’re behind the wheel and remember to put away
your smartphone while driving.
Sincerely,
DAVID S. KIM
Secretary
California State Transportation Agency

NEW 2020 LAWS
Effective January 1, 2020
SB 485 (Beall, Ch. 505, Stats. 2019)
This law repeals provisions that authorize or require courts to suspend,
revoke, or restrict a driver, or order the Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) to delay licensure for a person convicted of prostitution or vandalism,
a minor convicted of unlawful possession or use of a firearm, or offenses
related to possession, purchase, sale, or transport of controlled substances
involving the use of a vehicle. The law also prohibits courts from ordering
DMV to delay licensure, suspend, revoke, or restrict a person based upon
a conviction of minor’s possession/use of controlled substances or alcohol
for specified violations.
AB 2918 (Holden, Ch. 723, Stats. 2018)
This law requires the DMV to include information in the California
Driver Handbook regarding a person’s civil rights during a traffic stop,
including the right to file a complaint against a peace officer, as specified.
The following information was developed by the civil rights section of the
Department of Justice in consultation with DM V, the California Highway
Patrol, the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, and civil
rights organizations:
Your Rights During an Enforcement Stop
If an officer asks your permission to do something, you have a right to
say no. However, if you say no and the officer says they are going to do it
anyway, you do not have a right to interfere with their actions. For example,
an officer may request to search part or all of your vehicle. Yo u have a right
to decline that request, but the officer may have the legal authority to search
your vehicle anyway under certain circumstances. If you do not want the
officer to search your vehicle, you should clearly say that you do not give
your permission, but you do not have a right to resist or obstruct the officer
if they search your vehicle anyway.
The driver of a stopped vehicle must produce a driver license, proof of
insurance, and vehicle registration when stopped by law enforcement. If
a driver does not produce these documents, officers may conduct a limited
search for them. An officer may also request the names or identification
of passengers. Passengers can decline that request, but under some
circumstances the passengers may be required to identify themselves
anyway. If passengers do not want to produce their identification, they
should clearly say so. Passengers should not interfere with the officer’s
– vi –
duties in conducting the traffic stop, and if an officer demands identification,
passengers should not interfere with the officer’s actions. During a traffic
stop, an officer can legally require the driver and all passengers to exit or
stay inside the vehicle–if you are told to exit the vehicle or stay inside, you
must do so.
In California, only federal law enforcement officers can ask you about
your immigration status. California law prohibits state and local officers
from asking drivers or passengers about their immigration status. If a
California law enforcement officer asks you about your immigration status,
you can decline to answer.
In general, the First Amendment protects the right of drivers and
passengers to record interactions with police in public spaces. If you are
recording, you should immediately make that clear. You do not have a right
to interfere with the officer’s lawful duties during the enforcement stop, and
you should not reach into concealed areas to retrieve your recording device
without the officer’s permission. If your recording is not interfering with the
officer’s ability to lawfully do their job, an officer cannot confiscate your
recording device, delete the recording, or destroy the device just because you
are using it to record. In general, you also have the right to deny a request
to “unlock” a cellular phone or provide a password to it, though under some
circumstances–such as if you are on parole–you may have to give permission
in response to such requests. Finally, no government employee can retaliate
against you just because you recorded something in public.
Even if you believe your rights were violated, you should not engage
in physical resistance or violence against the officer. If an officer does
something that you believe violates your rights, you can voice your objection,
but you should not physically resist. Everyone has the right to be safe during
a traffic stop; your safety and the officer’s safety could be jeopardized if the
situation escalates with physical resistance or violence.
All members of the public have a right to file a complaint against any
peace officer or law enforcement agency, and it is against the law for any
government employee to retaliate against you for doing so. You can file
a complaint with any agency that employs the officer, whether a sheriff’s
office, police department, or any other law enforcement agency. You have
a right to be free from discrimination based on your actual or perceived
race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, gender identity
or expression, sexual orientation, mental or physical disability, medical
condition, or citizenship status. You also have other rights guaranteed by
the United States and California Constitutions, as well as California and
federal laws. When you file a complaint, the agency that employs the officer
must investigate the complaint. Links to contact information for California
law enforcement agencies can be found at: %3Chttps://post.ca.gov/le-agencies%3E.

GENERAL INFORMATION
Disclaimer
This handbook provides a summary of the laws and regulations outlined
in the California Vehicle Code (CVC). The Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV), law enforcement, and the courts follow the full and exact
language of the CVC. You may view the CVC at leginfo.legislature.
ca.gov or purchase a CVC book at any DMV field office. The CVC and
DMV fees are available online at [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov)[.](https://dmv.ca.gov)[ ](https://dmv.ca.gov)Fees listed in the California
Driver Handbook are subject to change.
This handbook is primarily for a basic Class C DL. For detailed
information on other DL types and endorsements, refer to various other
California DMV Handbooks: California Commercial Driver Handbook,
Recreational Vehicles and Trailers Handbook, Ambulance Driver
Handbook, California Parent-Teen Training Guide, and California
Motorcycle Handbook.
DMV’s Function and Vision
DMV is a state-level government agency whose two primary functions
are to license California drivers and register vehicles within the state.
However, DMV also maintains and oversees many other functions.
DMV’s vision is to be a trusted leader in delivering innovative services.
This vision is supported by DMV’s mission to proudly serve the public by
licensing drivers, registering vehicles, securing identities, and regulating
the motor vehicle industry.
Accurate Identification
The reliability, integrity, and confidentiality of all California DL/ID cards
are of prime concern to all levels of government, the private sector, and
general public.
It is critical that these documents be completely authenticated and
accurate. California law requires that all customers who apply for an
original California DL/ID card or REAL ID Compliant DL/ID card
submit acceptable documents establishing their identity, social security
number (SSN), if eligible, and 2 California residency documents. Your
true full name as shown on your identity document will appear on your
DL/ID card.
– 1 –
Basic Information
A California DL shows that you have been given permission by the state
to drive on public roadways. You may apply for a DL at most DMV field
offices (refer to page [viii](#br10)). After you complete your application for a
DL, pay the application fee, pass all applicable knowledge tests, show that
your physical and/or mental condition is satisfactory, and demonstrate
your ability to drive safely, a license may be issued and mailed to you.
If you have a medical condition or a disability, DMV may require you to
take a driving test. You may also have to provide a statement from your
physician regarding your current health condition.
It is a misdemeanor to drive in California with an expired DL. If you do,
you may be cited, your vehicle may be impounded, and you may have to
appear in court.
THE CALIFORNIA DRIVER LICENSE
Who Must Have a Driver License?
California Residents
California residents who drive on public highways or use parking facilities
that are open to the public must have a California DL, unless they are:
• An officer or employee of the United States (U.S.) government operating
a vehicle owned or controlled by the U.S. government on federal
business, except when operating a commercial motor vehicle.
• Driving or operating implements of husbandry not operated or moved
over a highway.
• Driving or operating an off-highway vehicle to cross a highway.
California Resident Military Personnel (U.S. Armed Forces)
If you are out of state on active military duty and have a valid California
DL, you and your spouse’s California DL will be valid for the full time
you are absent from California and for 30 days following your discharge
date, if you are honorably discharged outside of California. Carry both
your DL and discharge or separation documents during those 30 days
(CVC §12817).
Call 1-800-777-0133 to obtain an Extension of License for Person in
Armed Forces (DL 236) card which extends your California DL.
Note: Your DL is not valid if it is suspended, cancelled, or revoked.
– 2 –
Nonresident Military Personnel Stationed in California
If you are 18 years old or older, refer to the “California Residents” and
“Adults Visiting California” sections in this handbook for additional
information. Licensees eligible for military extensions should carry
documentation from their home state to verify their status to law
enforcement.
New California Residents
When you become a California resident and you want to drive in
California, you must apply for a California DL within 10 days. Residency
is established in a variety of ways, including the following:
• Being registered to vote in California elections.
• Paying resident tuition at a California college or university.
• Filing for a homeowner’s property tax exemption.
• Receiving any other privilege or benefit not ordinarily extended to
nonresidents.
Adults Visiting California
Visitors over 18 years old with a valid DL from their home state or country
may drive in California without getting a California DL as long as their
home state or country DL is valid.

Application, you must also bring an acceptable true full name document.
Your fingerprint, signature, and photograph will also be taken (refer to the

the formation of a domestic partnership, or a dissolution of marriage/
domestic partnership document containing your legal name as a result
of the court order.
• Examples of acceptable residency documents include: home utility
bill (including cell phone), insurance documents, California title or
registration for a vehicle or vessel, or record of a financial institution. A
parent, legal guardian, or child may use a birth certificate, and a spouse

flights or enter military bases and most federal facilities.
If you have a U.S. passport, passport card, military ID, or another form

documents will still be accepted to board an airplane. The federal REAL
ID Act of 2005 was passed in response to the events of 9/11. For more on
the REAL ID Act, visit the Department of Homeland Security website at
dhs.gov.
DoI Need a REAL ID?
The REAL ID Compliant DL/ID card is optional.
If you have a valid U.S. passport, passport card, military ID, or other
federally approved ID, you may use this as your form of ID to pass a TSA
checkpoint at airports nationwide and visit a secure federal building or
military installation at any time.
If you know you will not be boarding a domestic flight or visiting a secure
federal facility or military base, you do not need a REAL ID Compliant
DL/ID card.
You do not need a REAL ID Compliant DL/ID card to do any of the
following:
• Drive.
• Vote.
• Apply for or receive federal benefits (Veterans Affairs, Social Security
Administration (SSA), etc.).

• Visit a hospital or receive life-saving services.
How Do I Prepare to Apply fora REAL ID Card?
To apply for a REAL ID card, you must do the following:
• Provide proof of identity.
• Provide 2 California residency documents.

Note: If you are at least 17½ years old, you may obtain a permit without
completing driver education or driver training. However, you cannot get
a DL before you are 18 years old.
Minors’ Permit Restrictions

will sign the permit to validate it. You must practice with a licensed
California driver: parent, guardian, driving instructor, spouse, or adult 25
years old or older. The person must sit close enough to you to take control
of the vehicle at any time. A provisional permit does not allow you to drive
alone at any time, not even to a DMV field office to take a driving test.

a subsequent test, and wait 14 days (2 weeks), not including the day the
test was failed before you are retested. If you fail the driving test 3 times,
the application is no longer valid and you must reapply.
– 13 –
Once you have your provisional DL, you may drive alone, as long as you
do not have any collisions or traffic violations on your driving record.
During the first 12 months after you are licensed, you cannot drive
between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. and cannot transport passengers under 20
years old, unless accompanied by a California-licensed parent or guardian,
a California-licensed driver 25 years old or older, or a licensed or certified
driving instructor.
When you become 18 years old, the “provisional” part of your DL ends.
You may keep your provisional photo DL or pay a fee for a duplicate DL
without the word “provisional.”
Exceptions – Minors’ Driver License Restrictions
The law allows the following exceptions when reasonable transportation
is not available and it is necessary to drive. A signed note explaining
the necessity to drive and the date when this driving necessity will end
must be kept in your possession for the following exceptions (emancipated
minors are excluded from this requirement):
• Medical necessity to drive when reasonable transportation alternatives
are inadequate. The note must be signed by a physician with the
diagnosis and probable date of recovery.
• Schooling or school-authorized activity. The note must be signed by the
school principal, dean, or designee.
• Employment necessity and the need to operate a vehicle as part of
your employment. The note must be signed by the employer verifying
employment.
• The necessity to drive an immediate family member. The note must
be signed by your parent(s) or legal guardian(s), stating the reason
and probable end date of the necessity to drive the immediate family
member.
Exception: These requirements do not apply to an emancipated minor.
Emancipated minors must provide DMV with court documents showing
that the court has granted a petition for emancipation and provide a
California Insurance Proof Certificate (SR 22/SR 1P) form in lieu of
their parent(s) or guarantor(s) signature(s). Emancipated minors are not
exempt from the integrated driver education and driver training program
requirements.
– 14 –
Out-Of-State Minors
All out-of-state minor applicants must comply with the application
requirements outlined in the “Applicati[on](#br18)[ ](#br18)[R](#br18)equirements for a Basic
Class C Driver License” section on page [6](#br18)[ ](#br18)and must have parent(s) or
legal guardian(s) signature on the Driver License & ID Card Application
(DL 44/eDL 44) form.
Out-Of-State Minors’ Perm it
Out-of-state minors’ permit applicants must meet the requirements listed
in the “Minors’ Permit Requirements” section on page [12](#br24). In addition,
if your driver education and driver training courses were taken in a state
other than California, DMV may accept a To Secondary Schools Other
Than California Schools (DL 33) form completed by the out-of-state
secondary school. You may obtain a DL 33 at your local DMV field office
or by calling DMV at 1-800-777-0133. Send the DL 33 to your out-of-state
secondary school and ask them to complete and return it to you.
Out-Of-State Minors’ DriverLicense
You will be asked to present your out-of-state DL and pass a knowledge
test as part of the application process. The behind-the-wheel driving test
for holders of out-of-state DLs are normally waived. However, DMV may
require a behind-the-wheel driving test for any type of DL application.
Note: Out-of-state minor applicants are subject to all provisional
restrictions per California law for the first year of the DL or until they
turn 18 years old.
Actions Against the Provisional Driver License
Teenagers as a group average twice as many collisions as adult drivers,
while driving only half as many miles. The teenage collision rate per mile
is 4 times greater than the adult driver collision rate per mile. Traffic deaths
of new drivers are deadly combinations of their inexperience driving, lack
of familiarity with the vehicle, and their need to push themselves and the
vehicle to the limit.
– 15 –
Keeping YourProvisional DriverLicense
DMV will track your driving record and take actions based upon any
collisions or violations as follows:
• If you get a traffic ticket and fail to appear in court, DMV will suspend
your driving privilege until you appear in court.
• If you have 1 “at fault” collision or conviction of a traffic law violation
within 12 months, DMV will send you a warning letter.
• If you have 2 “at fault” collisions or convictions (or combination) of a
traffic law violation within 12 months, you cannot drive for 30 days,
unless accompanied by your licensed parent or other licensed adult who
is at least 25 years old.
• If you have 3 “at fault” collisions or convictions (or any combination)
of a traffic law violation within 12 months, you will be suspended for 6
months and placed on probation for 1 year.
• If you have 4 or more “at fault” collisions or point count convictions of
traffic law violations while on probation, you will be suspended again
(traffic law violations resolved in juvenile court are also reported to
DMV).
• If you are convicted of using alcohol or a controlled substance and you
are between 13 to 21 years old, the court orders DMV to suspend your
DL for 1 year. If you do not have a DL, the court orders DMV to delay
your eligibility to apply for a DL. You may also be required to complete
a DUI program.
Any restriction, suspension, or probation will continue for its full term
past your 18th birthday. Other, stronger actions may be taken if your
driving record justifies them. Remember, if your driving privilege has
been suspended or revoked, you may not drive.
Minors and Cell Phones
• It is against the law for a minor to use a cell phone or electronic wireless
communications device while driving. Do not answer calls or send/
respond to text messages.
• Convictions for violations of this law are subject to fines.
Exceptions: You may use a cell phone only to contact law enforcement,
a health care provider, the fire department, or another emergency entity
in an emergency situation when driving.

your death. When you apply for or renew your DL/ID card and check the
“Yes, add or keep my name on the donor registry” box, your name will be
added to the Donate Life California Organ Tissue Donor Registry and a
Pink DONOR dot will appear on your DL/ID card. You must mark Yes to
maintain the DONOR dot on your DL/ID card. When you check the “I do
not wish to register to be an organ or tissue donor at this time” box, your
name will not be removed from the registry. If you wish to remove your
name from the registry, you must contact Donate Life California. DMV
can remove the DONOR dot from your DL/ID card but cannot remove
you from the registry. You may also provide a $ 2 voluntary contribution
to support and promote organ and tissue donation by checking the “Would
you like to make a voluntary  $2 contribution?” box. As outlined in the
California Anatomical Gift Act, your authorization is legally binding and,
unless the donor is under 18 years old, your decision does not require
the consent of any other person. For registered donors under 18 years
old, the legal guardian shall make the final donation decision. You may
limit your donation to specific organs or tissues, place usage restrictions
(for example, transplantation or research), obtain more information about
donation, change or update your donor status or information including
your name and address, or remove your name from the registry on the
Donate Life California website at: [donateLIFEcalifornia.org](https://donateLIFEcalifornia.org).
Veteran Designation and Benefit Information
For an additional $ 5 fee, DMV offers those who proudly served
our country the option to mark the face of their DL/ID card with the
word “VETERAN” to indicate they served in the U.S. Armed Forces.
In addition, DMV will refer veterans to the California Department of
Veterans Affairs to determine eligibility for benefits acquired while
serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.
How Can I Get Veterans Desi gnati on?
• Visit County Veterans Service Officers (CVSO) to obtain a signed,
certified Veteran Status Verification Form (VSD-001).
• Visit a DMV field office to request the Veterans designation be added
to the DL/ID card.
• For more information, visit the DMV website at [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov)[ ](https://dmv.ca.gov)or refer to
the Are You a Veteran? (FFDL 43) Fast Facts brochure. The California
Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) Connect program would like
– 21 –
you to receive information regarding benefits, such as employment,
housing, education, and health care services for which you may be
entitled. Check the “If you have served, would you like to receive benefits
information for which you may be eligible?” box on the DL 44/eDL 44
form. DMV will transmit your name and mailing address to CalVet for
them to forward you benefits information. To locate a CalVet office near
you, refer to your local government listing in your telephone book, visit

Register To Vote
You may register to vote or update your voter registration with DMV
when applying for an original DL/ID, renewing your DL/ID, or changing
your address. For more information, visit [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov).
Unlicensed Drivers
It is against the law to loan your vehicle to a person who is unlicensed or
whose driving privilege has been suspended or revoked. If an unlicensed
person is caught driving your vehicle, it may be impounded for 30 days
(CVC §14607.6). No person of any age may drive on a highway or in a
public parking facility unless they have a valid DL or permit. The law also
states that you must not employ, permit, or authorize any person to drive
your vehicle on a public street or highway, unless they are licensed to
drive that class of vehicle. A person must be at least 21 years old to drive
most commercial vehicles for hire in interstate commerce and to transport
hazardous materials or wastes.
Diplomatic Driver Licenses
Nonresidents who possess a valid diplomatic DL issued by the U.S.
Department of State are exempt from California driver licensing
requirements.
Identification (ID) Cards
DMV issues ID cards to eligible persons of any age. To obtain an original
ID card, you must present an identity document, residency document, and
provide your SSN (refer to the “Obtaining a Driver License” section on
page [4](#br16)). The ID card is valid until the 6th birthday after the issue date.
If you meet certain requirements for specific public assistance programs,
you may be eligible to apply for a reduced-fee ID card. Government
or nonprofit organizations determine whether an individual meets the
requirements for a reduced-fee ID card.
– 22 –
Note: If you are 62 years old or older, you may obtain a free senior citizen
ID card with the words “Senior Identification Card” indicated on the front.
The Senior ID card is valid until the 8th birthday after the issue date.
No-Fee ID Cards
• Drivers who are no longer able to drive safely because of a physical and/
or mental (P&M) condition may be eligible to exchange their valid DL
for a no-fee ID card, if certain guidelines are met.
• If you are a “homeless person” as defined by the McKinney-Vento
Act, which includes, but is not limited to, a homeless child or youth,
homeless person, or individual or family fleeing domestic violence,
dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or another dangerous life-
threatening condition, you may be eligible for a no-fee ID card.
Visit [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov)[ ](https://dmv.ca.gov)or call 1-800-777-0133 for additional information.
Identification (ID) Card Renewal by Mail or
Internet
Customers who are eligible to renew their ID card by mail or Internet
will receive a notice approximately 120 days before the expiration of their
current ID card. Reduced-fee ID cards cannot be renewed by mail or
Internet.
Driving Schools
When learning to drive, you should seek qualified instruction, either with a
public or private high school or a state-licensed professional driving school.
DMV licenses professional schools and instructors in California that meet
rigid qualifying standards. Schools must carry liability insurance, hold a
bond, and maintain complete records for DMV inspection. Vehicles are
subject to annual inspection. Instructors must pass a written examination
every 3 years or show proof of continuing education in the traffic safety
field. If you use the services of a professional driving school, ask to see the
instructor’s ID card. Visit [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov)[ ](https://dmv.ca.gov)or refer to the Selecting a Driving
School for Driver Education and Driver Training (DE/DT) (FFDL 33)
Fast Facts brochure for additional information.

Mature Driver Program
The Mature Driver Program is an 8-hour course for drivers 55 years old
and older. This course covers a variety of topics of special interest to the
mature driver and is available from DMV-approved course providers. Visit
the DMV website for more information. Your insurance company may
offer discounts for those who complete the class and receive a completion
certificate. The certificate is valid for 3 years and can be renewed by
completing a 4-hour course.
Pedestrian Responsibilities
Pedestrians (including joggers) should be aware of traffic conditions. Watch
out for drivers before assuming you have the right-of-way when crossing
a street. Be aware that hybrid and electric vehicles are virtually silent
when running on electric power and you may not hear them approaching
an intersection. Yield the right-of-way to vehicles when you cross a street
between intersections and in areas with no pedestrian crosswalks or
signals. Remember: Making eye contact with a driver does not mean the
driver will yield the right-of-way. Do not suddenly leave a curb or other
safe place, and walk or run into the path of a vehicle close enough to be a
danger to you. This is true even though you are in a crosswalk. The law
states that drivers must always yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian, but
if the driver cannot stop in time to avoid hitting you, you still run the
risk of being hit. Avoid distractions as a pedestrian. Do not use your cell
phone or electronic wireless communications device while moving. To
avoid becoming a hazard to vehicles and other pedestrians, you should
be aware of your surroundings at all times. Always obey traffic signal
lights. Whether the intersection has pedestrian or traffic signal lights,
you must obey the pedestrian rules (refer to pages [29](#br41)[ ](#br41)and [30](#br42)). At an
intersection where traffic is not controlled by traffic signal lights, drivers
are required to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within any crosswalk,
marked or unmarked.
When a traffic signal light changes to green or “WALK,” look left,
right, and then left again, and yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the
intersection before the traffic signal light changes.
If the traffic signal light begins blinking or changes to “DON’T WALK,”
or to an upraised hand after you have gone part way across a divided
street, you may continue across the street. Do not stop or delay traffic
unnecessarily while crossing a street. Pedestrians are not permitted on
– 24 –
any toll bridge or highway crossing, unless there is a sidewalk and signs
stating pedestrian traffic is permitted.
If there are no sidewalks, walk facing
oncoming traffic. Do not walk or jog
on any freeway where signs tell you
that pedestrians are not allowed. Do
not walk or jog in a bike lane unless
there is no sidewalk. At night, make
yourself more visible by:
• Wearing white, light, or reflective
material clothing.
• Carrying a flashlight.
New Technology
Your vehicle may have technology that allows you to have cell phone
conversations or play music from an electronic wireless communications
device. With the increase of such technologies, it is important to remain
aware of road conditions and avoid driving distractions. Here are some
tips to reduce technological distractions:
• Do not input navigation instructions while driving.
• Do not adjust music or other electronic wireless communications
devices while driving.
• For navigation devices, use the audio navigation function when possible.
Note: Technology, such as backup cameras and self-parking, cannot
solely be used on a driving test. The purpose of a driving test is to ensure
your ability to drive.

OCCUPANT PROTECTION
Seat Belts
Wearing seat belts is the law. Always
fasten your seat belt and make sure all your
passengers are using seat belts or child
restraints. Wearing seat belts (both lap belt
and shoulder harness) will increase your
chance of survival in most types of collisions.
It is important to wear the seat belt correctly.
• A shoulder harness is worn across the
shoulder and chest with minimal, if any,
slack. The shoulder harness should not be
worn under the arm or behind the back.
Wearing the harness the wrong way could
cause serious internal injuries in a collision.
• The lap belt should be adjusted so that it is
snug and lies low across your hips after fastening. Otherwise, in a crash,
you could slide out of the belt, resulting in injury or death.
• Pregnant women should wear the lap belt as low as possible under the
abdomen, and the shoulder strap should be placed between the breasts
and to the side of the abdomen’s bulge.
You and all passengers must wear a seat belt or you and/or your passenger(s)
may be cited. If the passenger is under 16 years old, you may be cited if
they are not wearing their seat belt.
The graphic illustrates what can happen in a collision. If you are struck
from the side, the impact could push you back and forth across the seat.
Seat belts and shoulder harnesses keep you in a better position to control
the vehicle and may minimize serious injuries. The graphic also illustrates
how, when you collide, your vehicle stops, but you keep going at the same
speed you were traveling, until you hit the dashboard or windshield.
Child Restraint System and Safety Seats
Your child must be secured by either a federally-approved child passenger
restraint system or a safety belt depending on their height and age.
• Children under 2 years old must be secured in a rear-facing child
passenger restraint system unless the child is 40 pounds or more, or 3
feet 4 inches or taller.
– 26 –
• Children under 8 years old, or who are less than 4 feet 9 inches tall, must
be properly secured in a federally-approved child passenger restraint
system.
• Children under 8 years old may ride in the front seat of a vehicle in a
federally-approved child passenger restraint system under the following
instances:
— There is no rear seat.
— The rear seats are side-facing jump seats.
— The rear seats are rear-facing seats.
— The child passenger restraint system cannot be installed properly
in the rear seat.
— All rear seats are already occupied by children 7 years old or
younger.
— Medical reasons require the child to not ride in the back seat.
• A child may not ride in the front seat of an airbag equipped vehicle if
they are in a rear-facing child passenger restraint system.
• Children who are 8 years old or older OR who have reached at least 4
feet 9 inches in height may use a properly secured safety belt meeting
federal standards.
Note: Child passenger restraint system installation may be checked by
contacting local law enforcement agencies and fire departments. As your
child grows, check to see if the child passenger restraint system is the right
size for your child.
Riding Safely with Air Bags
Air bags are a safety feature that help keep you safer than a seat belt
alone. Ride at least 10 inches (measured from the center of the steering
wheel to your breastbone) from the air bag cover, if you can do this while
maintaining full control of the vehicle. If you cannot safely sit 10 inches
away from the air bag, contact your vehicle dealer or manufacturer for
advice about additional ways of moving back from your air bag.
Passengers should also sit at least 10 inches away from the passenger-side
air bag.
Important: Children seated next to a side air bag may be at risk of
serious or fatal injury.
– 27 –
Unattended Children in Motor Vehicles
It is never a good idea to leave a child unattended in a vehicle. It is illegal
to leave a child 6 years old or younger unattended in a motor vehicle.
Note: A child may be left under the supervision of a person 12 years old
or older.
Distracted Driving
Anything that prevents you from operating your vehicle safely is a
distraction. The following are the 3 types of driver distractions:
• Visual—Eyes off the road.
• Cognitive—Mind off the road.
• Manual—Hands off the steering wheel.
Some actions that cause distracted driving and lead to vehicle collisions
are:
• Using a handheld device (for example, cell phone or music device).
• Reaching for an object inside the vehicle.
• Looking at an object or event outside of the vehicle.
• Reading.
• Eating.
• Applying cosmetics (makeup).
More information regarding collisions and distractions can be found in
the Driver Distractions (FFDL 28) Fast Facts brochure.
Hot Weather Risks
It is dangerous and illegal to leave children (CVC §15620) and/or animals
in a hot vehicle. After sitting in the sun, even if a window is slightly
opened, the temperature can rise rapidly inside a parked vehicle.
Dehydration, heat stroke, and death can result from overexposure to the
heat. California Penal Code §597.7 prohibits leaving or confining an
animal in an unattended motor vehicle under conditions that endanger
the health or well-being of an animal due to heat.

TRAFFIC CONTROLS
Traffic Signal Lights
Solid Red–A red traffic signal light means “STOP.” You can
make a right turn against a red traffic signal light after you stop.
Yield to pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles close enough to be a
hazard. Make the right turn only when it is safe. Do not turn if a
“NO TURN ON RED” sign is posted.
Red Arrow–A red arrow means “STOP.” Remain stopped until
the green signal or green arrow appears. Do not turn against a
red arrow.
Flashing Red–A flashing red traffic signal light means “STOP.”
After stopping, you may proceed when it is safe. Observe the
right-of-way rules.
Solid Yellow–A yellow traffic signal light means “CAUTION.”
The red traffic signal light is about to appear. When you see the
yellow traffic signal light, stop if you can do so safely. If you
cannot stop safely, cross the intersection cautiously.
Yellow Arrow–A yellow arrow means the “protected” turning
time period is ending. Be prepared to obey the next traffic signal
light, which could be the green or red traffic signal light or red
arrow.
Flashing Yellow–A flashing yellow traffic signal light warns
you to “PROCEED WITH CAUTION.” Slow down and be alert
before entering the intersection. Yield to any pedestrians,
bicyclists, or vehicles in the intersection. Yo u do not need to stop
for a flashing yellow traffic signal light.
Flashing Yellow Arrow–This traffic signal light means turns
are permitted (unprotected), but you must first yield to oncoming
traffic and pedestrians and then proceed with caution.
Solid Green–Give the right-of-way to any vehicle, bicyclist,
or pedestrian in the intersection. A green traffic signal light
means “GO.” If you are turning left, make the turn only if
you have enough space to complete the turn before creating a
hazard for any oncoming vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian. Do not enter the
intersection if you cannot get completely across before the traffic signal
light turns red. If you block the intersection, you can be cited.
– 29 –
Green Arrow–A green arrow means “GO.” You must turn in
the direction the arrow is pointing after you yield to any vehicle,
bicyclist, or pedestrian still in the intersection. The green arrow
allows you to make a “protected” turn. Oncoming vehicles, bicyclists, and
pedestrians are stopped by a red traffic signal light as long as the green
arrow is lighted.
Traffic Signal Light Not Working (Blackout)–The traffic signal light is
not working and/or no lights are showing on the signal. Proceed cautiously
as if the intersection is controlled by “STOP” signs in all directions.
Pedestrian Signal Lights
Pedestrian traffic signal lights show words or pictures similar to the
following examples:
“Walk” or “Walking Person” pedestrian traffic signal light
means it is legal to cross the street.
“Don’t Walk” or “Raised Hand” pedestrian traffic signal light
means you may not start crossing the street.
Flashing “Don’t Walk” or Flashing “Raised Hand” traffic
signal light means do not start crossing the street because the
traffic signal light is about to change. If a pedestrian begins
crossing the street after the traffic signal light starts flashing, wait
until the pedestrian(s) has crossed the street before proceeding.
Pedestrian traffic signal lights may also show numbers to indicate how
many seconds remain for crossing. These pedestrian traffic signal lights
allow pedestrians the flexibility to speed up if the crossing phase is about
to expire.
Pedestrian Phases (also called Pedestrian Scrambles)
are a series of crisscross, diagonal crosswalks that allow
pedestrians to cross in any direction at the same time,
including diagonally across the intersection. These signals
stop all vehicle traffic during the scramble phase. Some
pedestrian traffic signal lights may provide a beeping or chirping sound
or a verbal message. These traffic signal lights are designed to help blind
or visually-impaired pedestrians cross the street.
At many traffic signal lights, you need to push the pedestrian button to
activate the “Walk” or “Walking Person” pedestrian traffic signal light.
If there are no pedestrian signals, obey the vehicle traffic signal lights.

Traffic Signs
The shape and color of a sign offers you a clue about the
information contained on the sign. Here are the common
shapes used:
An 8-sided red STOP sign indicates that you must make a
full “STOP” whenever you see this sign. Stop at the white
limit line (a wide white line painted on the street) or before
entering the crosswalk. If a limit line or crosswalk is not
painted on the street, stop before entering the intersection.
Check traffic in all directions before proceeding.
STOP
A 3-sided red YIELD sign indicates that you must slow
down and be ready to stop, if necessary, to let any vehicle,
bicyclist, or pedestrian pass before you proceed.
A square red and white regulatory sign indicates that you
must follow the sign’s instruction. For example, the DO NOT
ENTER sign means do not enter a road or off ramp where
the sign is posted (usually on a freeway off ramp). The
WRONG WAY sign may or may not be posted with the DO
NOT ENTER sign. If you see one or both of these signs,
drive to the side of the road and stop. Yo u are going against
traffic. When safe, back out or turn around and return to the
road you were on. At night if you are going the wrong way,
the road reflectors will shine red in your headlights.
DO NOT
ENTER
WRONG
WAY
A sign that has a red circle with a red line through it always
indicates “NO.” The picture inside the circle shows what you
cannot do. The sign may be shown with or without words.
A yellow and black circular sign or an x-shaped sign indicates
that you are approaching a railroad crossing. You must look,
listen, slow down, and prepare to stop, if necessary. Let any
trains pass before you proceed. Many railroad crossings will
also have a blue and white sign to indicate what to do if there
is an emergency on or near the tracks, or if your vehicle has
stalled on the tracks.
R
R
A 5-sided sign indicates that you are near a school. Stop if
children are in the crosswalk.
A 4-sided diamond-shaped sign warns you of specific road
conditions and dangers ahead. Many warning signs are
diamond-shaped.

A white rectangular sign indicates that you must obey important rules.
Some warning signs have a fluorescent yellow-green background. These
signs warn of conditions related to pedestrians, bicyclists, schools,
playgrounds, school buses, and school passenger loading zones. Obey all
warning signs regardless of their shape or color (refer to pages [32](#br44)[ ](#br44)and
[33](#br45)[ ](#br45)for examples).
LAWS AND RULES OF THE ROAD
Ri ght-of-Way Rules
General I nform ation
Never assume other drivers will give you the right-of-way. Respecting
the right-of-way of others is not limited to situations such as yielding to
pedestrians in crosswalks, or watching carefully to ensure the right-of-
way of bicyclists and motorcyclists. Yield your right-of-way when it helps
to prevent collisions.
Pedestrians
A pedestrian is a person on foot or who uses a conveyance such as roller
skates, skateboard, etc., other than a bicycle. A pedestrian can also be a
person with a disability using a tricycle, quadricycle, or wheelchair for
transportation.
• If you approach a pedestrian crossing at a corner or other crosswalk,
even if the crosswalk is in the middle of the block, at a corner with or
without traffic signal lights, whether or not the crosswalk is marked by
painted lines, you are required to exercise caution and reduce your
speed, or stop if necessary, to ensure the safety of the pedestrian.
• Do not pass a vehicle stopped at a crosswalk.
A pedestrian you cannot see may be
crossing the street. Stop and proceed when
all pedestrians have crossed the street.
• Do not drive on a sidewalk, except to cross
it to enter or exit a driveway or alley. When
crossing, yield to all pedestrians.
• Do not stop in a crosswalk. You will place pedestrians in danger.
• Remember, if a pedestrian makes eye contact with you, they are ready
to cross the street. Yield to the pedestrian.
– 34 –
• Allow sufficient time to cross the street for:
— Older pedestrians.
— Disabled pedestrians.
— Pedestrians with young children.
• Obey signs pertaining to pedestrians. Examples include:
• When a blind person pulls in their cane and steps
away from the intersection, this gesture usually
means for you to go (additional information
regarding blind pedestrians can be found on page
[80](#br92)).
Important: Blind pedestrians rely on the sound of
your vehicle to become aware of your vehicle’s presence, and the sound of
the pedestrian signal to know when they are able to safely cross the street.
It is important that you stop your vehicle within 5 feet of the crosswalk.
Drivers of hybrid or electric vehicles must remain especially aware that
the lack of engine or electric motor noise may cause a blind pedestrian to
assume there is not a vehicle nearby.
Crosswalks
A crosswalk is the part of the roadway set aside for pedestrian traffic.
When required to stop because of a sign or signal, you must stop
before the stop line, crosswalk, stop sign, or signal. Yo u must yield to
pedestrians entering or in a crosswalk. Not all crosswalks are marked.
If there is a stop line before the crosswalk, the stop line must be obeyed
first. Although pedestrians have the right-of-way, they also must abide
by the rules of the road. If you approach a crosswalk while driving, you
are required to exercise caution and reduce your speed to safeguard the
pedestrian. You may need to stop to ensure the safety of the pedestrian,
as outlined in CVC §21950. Crosswalks are often marked with white
lines. Yellow crosswalk lines may be painted at school crossings. Some
crosswalks have flashing lights to warn you that pedestrians may be
crossing. Look for pedestrians and be prepared to stop, whether or not
the lights are flashing.
I ntersecti ons
An intersection is any place where one line of roadway meets another
roadway. Intersections include cross streets, side streets, alleys, freeway
entrances, and any other location where vehicles traveling on different
highways or roads join each other.
– 35 –
• At intersections without “STOP” or “YIELD” signs, slow down and be
ready to stop. Yield to traffic and pedestrians already in the intersection
or just entering the intersection. Also, yield to the vehicle or bicycle that
arrives first, or to the vehicle or bicycle on your right if it reaches the
intersection at the same time as you.
• At “T” intersections without “STOP” or “YIELD” signs, yield to traffic
and pedestrians on the through road. They have the right-of-way.
• When you turn left, give the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching
that are close enough to be dangerous. Also, look for motorcyclists,
bicyclists, and pedestrians.
Safety suggestion: While waiting to turn left, keep your wheels pointed
straight ahead until it is safe to start your turn. If your wheels are pointed
to the left, and a vehicle hits you from behind, you could be pushed into
oncoming traffic.
• When you turn right, be sure to check for pedestrians who want to cross
the street and bicyclists riding next to you.
• On divided highways or highways with several lanes, watch for vehicles
coming in any lane you cross. Turn either left or right only when it is safe.
• When there are “STOP” signs at all corners, stop first and then follow
the rules listed above.
• If you park on the side of the road or are leaving a parking lot, etc., yield
to traffic before reentering the road.
Roundabouts
A roundabout is an intersection where
traffic travels around a central island in a
counter-clockwise direction. Vehicles or
bicycles entering or exiting the roundabout
must yield to all traffic including
pedestrians.
Driving in a roundabout:
• Slow down as you approach the
roundabout.
• Yield to pedestrians and bicyclists Multiple and single lane
crossing the roadway.
roundabout
• Watch for signs and/or pavement
markings that guide or prohibit certain movements.
• Enter the roundabout (heading to the right) when there is a big enough
gap in traffic to merge safely.
– 36 –
• Travel in a counter-clockwise direction. Do not stop or pass.
• Signal when you change lanes or exit the roundabout.
• If you miss your exit, continue around until you return to your exit. For
roundabouts with multiple lanes, choose your entry or exit lane based
on your destination as shown in the graphic.
On Mountain Roads
When 2 vehicles meet on a steep road where neither vehicle can pass, the
vehicle facing downhill must yield the right-of-way by backing up until
the vehicle going uphill can pass. The vehicle facing downhill has the
greater amount of control when backing up the hill.
Speed Limits
California’s “Basic Speed Law” means that you may never drive faster
than is safe for current conditions.
Regardless of the posted speed limit, your speed should depend on:
• The number and speed of other vehicles on the road.
• Whether the road surface is smooth, rough, graveled, wet, dry, wide,
or narrow.
• Bicyclists or pedestrians on or crossing the roadway.
• Whether it is raining, foggy, snowing, windy, or dusty.
Note: Unless otherwise posted, the maximum speed limit is 55 mph on a
two-lane undivided highway and for vehicles towing trailers.
Reduced Speeds
Heavy Traffic or Bad Weather
You must drive slower when there is heavy traffic or bad weather.
However, if you block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic by
driving too slowly, you may be cited. If you choose to drive slower than
other traffic, do not drive in the “Number 1 Lane” (fast lane) (refer to the
“Choosing a Lane” section on page [47](#br59)). When another driver is close
behind you and wishes to drive faster, you should move to the right.
Towing Vehicles, Buses, or Large Trucks
When you tow a vehicle or trailer, or drive a bus or 3 or more axle truck,
you must drive in the right most lane or in a lane specially marked for
slower vehicles. If no lanes are marked and there are 4 lanes or more in
your direction, you may only drive in either of the 2 lanes closest to the
right edge of the road. Pedestrians, bicyclists, or other vehicles alongside
you may experience sudden strong winds when passing or being passed.
– 37 –
Slow down and pass safely, and pass only at a safe distance (3 feet or more
for bicyclists).
Around Children
When driving within 500 to 1,000 feet of a school while children are
outside or crossing the street, the speed limit is 25 mph unless otherwise
posted. Also, if the school grounds have no fence and children are outside,
never drive faster than 25 mph. Some school zones may have speed limits
as low as 15 mph. Near schools, look for:
• Bicyclists and pedestrians.
• School safety patrols or crossing
guards. Be sure to obey their
directions. For the crossing guard’s
safety, allow them to safely get to
the side of the road before driving
ahead.
• Stopped school buses and children
crossing the street. Some school
buses flash yellow lights when
All vehicles must stop.
preparing to stop to let children off
the bus. The yellow flashing lights warn you to slow down and prepare
to stop. When the bus flashes red lights (located at the top front and
back of the bus), you must stop from either direction until the children
are safely across the street and the lights stop flashing. The law requires
you remain stopped as long as the red lights are flashing (CVC §22454).
If you fail to stop, you may be fined up to  $1,000 and your driving
privilege could be suspended for 1 year. If the school bus is on the
other side of a divided or multilane highway (two or more lanes in each
direction), you do not need to stop.

Blind Intersections
The speed limit for a blind intersection is 15 mph. An intersection is
considered “blind” if there are no stop signs at any corner and you cannot
see for 100 feet in either direction during the last 100 feet before crossing.
If your view is blocked, move slowly forward until you can see.

The speed limit in any alley is 15 mph.
Near Railroad Tracks
The speed limit is 15 mph within 100 feet of a railroad crossing where
you cannot see the tracks for 400 feet in both directions. You may drive
faster than 15 mph if the crossing is controlled by gates, a warning signal,
or a flagman.
At railroad or train crossings:
• Look in both directions and listen
for trains. Many crossings have
multiple tracks; so, be ready to stop
before crossing, if necessary. Cross
railroad tracks only at designated
crossings and only when it is safe
to do so.

tracks, wait until you can completely cross the tracks before proceeding.
Make sure your vehicle clears the tracks before you stop.
• Never stop on the railroad tracks. If you are on the tracks, you risk
injury or death.
• Watch for vehicles that must stop before they cross train tracks. These
vehicles include buses, school buses, and trucks transporting hazardous
loads.
• Remember that flashing red traffic signal lights mean STOP! Stop at
least 15 feet, but no more than 50 feet, from the nearest track when the
crossing devices are active or a person warns you a train is coming.
Stop if you see a train coming or you hear the whistle, horn, or bell of
an approaching train.
• Do not go under lowering gates or around lowered gates. Flashing red
warning lights indicate you must stop and wait. Do not proceed over the
railroad tracks until the red lights stop flashing, even if the gate rises.
– 40 –
If the gates are lowered and you do not see a train approaching, call the
posted railroad emergency toll-free number or 9-1-1. Be ready to give a
detailed description of your location.
Light-Rail Transit Vehicle Crossings
The same rules apply to light-rail transit vehicle crossings as to train
crossings.
Note: Light-rail transit vehicles are very quiet and accelerate more
quickly than trains.
Near Streetcars, Trolleys, or Buses
The passing speed limit, when safe
to pass, is no more than 10 mph. This
speed limit applies at a safety zone
or intersection where a streetcar,
trolley, or bus is stopped and traffic
is controlled by a peace officer or
traffic signal light. A safety zone is
marked by raised buttons or markers
on the road and set aside for pedestrians. You will most often see safety
zones in areas where street cars or trolleys and vehicles share the roadway.
Business or Residential Districts
The speed limit is 25 mph, unless otherwise posted.
Near Animals
If you see a sign with a picture of an animal (see example), be alert for
possible animals in or near the roadway. If you see animals or livestock
near the roadway, slow down and proceed with caution. Be sure to follow
directions from the person in charge of the animals. If you see
a stray animal in your path, slow down or stop if it’s safe. Do
not swerve as you may lose control of your vehicle and cause
an accident. Be aware of sudden movements from the animals
as they are unpredictable and may run into the roadway.

VISUAL SEARCH
Scanning
Scanning your surroundings (keeping your eyes moving) includes keeping
a safe distance around your vehicle. When another driver makes a mistake,
you need time to react. Give yourself this reaction time by keeping enough
space on all sides of your vehicle. This space will give you room to brake
or maneuver if necessary.
Know WhatIs Ahead
To avoid last minute moves, scan the road
10–15 seconds ahead of your vehicle so
you can see hazards early. Constantly
staring at the vehicle or road right in front
of your vehicle is dangerous. As you scan
ahead, be alert for vehicles around you.
Use your mirrors. Know what is behind
you, so you can prepare for what is ahead.
Take in the whole scene–If you only
look at the middle of the road, you will

road and behind you. Scanning helps you
to see:
• Cars, motorcycles, bicycles,
pedestrians, and animals that may be
in the road by the time you reach them.
• Signs warning of problems ahead.
• Signs giving you directions.
Before changing lanes, look into your
rearview mirror for nearby vehicles and
over your shoulder to check for blind
spots (see the yellow area in the image
above).
The shaded areas are your blind
spots.
Watch for hazards–Look beyond the vehicle ahead of you. Do not
develop a “fixed stare.” Check your rearview mirrors so you know the
position of vehicles near you. On the freeway, be ready for changes in
traffic conditions. Watch for signals from other drivers. Expect merging
vehicles at onramps and interchanges. Be prepared for rapid changes in
– 42 –
road conditions and traffic f low. Know which lanes are clear so you can
use them, if necessary.
Do not be a tailgater! Many drivers follow too closely (tailgate) and
are not able to see as far ahead as they should because the vehicle ahead
blocks their view.
If a vehicle merges in front of you too closely, take your foot off the
accelerator. This gives space between you and the vehicle ahead, without
having to slam on your brakes or swerve into another lane. To avoid
tailgating, use the “3 second rule”: when the vehicle ahead of you passes
a certain point, such as a sign, count “one-thousand-one, one-thousand-
two, one-thousand-three.” This takes approximately 3 seconds. If you pass
the same point before you finish counting, you are following too closely.
You should allow for more space when:
• A tailgater is behind you. Allow extra space ahead and do not brake
suddenly. Slow down gradually or merge into another lane to prevent a
collision with the tailgater!
• Driving on slippery roads.
• Following motorcyclists or bicyclists on wet or icy roads, metal
surfaces (for example, bridge gratings, railroad tracks, etc.), and gravel.
Motorcyclists and bicyclists can fall easily on these surfaces.
• The driver behind you wants to pass. Allow room in front of your vehicle
so the driver will have space to move in front of you.
• Towing a trailer or carrying a heavy load. The extra weight makes it
harder to stop.
• Following large vehicles that block your view ahead. The extra space
allows you to see around the vehicle.
• You see a bus, school bus, or a placarded vehicle at railroad crossings.
These vehicles must stop at railroad crossings.
• Merging onto a freeway.
Know WhatIs atYourSide
Any time you come to a place where people may cross or enter your path
or a line of traffic meets another, you should look to the left and right
sides of your vehicle to make sure no one is coming. Always look to each
side of your vehicle at intersections, crosswalks, and railroad crossings.
At intersections:
• Look both ways even if other traffic has a red traffic signal light or a
stop sign.
– 43 –
— Look to the left first, since vehicles coming from the left are closer
to you than vehicles coming from the right.
— Look to the right.
— Take one more look to the left in case there is a pedestrian, bicyclist,
or vehicle you did not see the first time.
• Do not rely on traffic signal lights. Some drivers do not obey traffic
signal lights. Before you enter an intersection, look left, right, and ahead
for approaching traffic.
To maintain enough space on each side of your vehicle:
• Do not stay in another driver’s blind spot. The other driver may not see
your vehicle and could change lanes and hit you.
• Avoid driving directly alongside other vehicles on multilane streets with
or without traffic in the opposite direction. Another driver might crowd
your lane or change lanes without looking and crash into you. Drive
either ahead of or behind the other vehicle.
• If possible and when safe, make room for vehicles entering freeways
even though you have the right-of-way.
• At freeway exits, do not drive alongside other vehicles. A driver may
decide to exit suddenly or swerve back onto the freeway.
• Keep a space between your vehicle and parked vehicles. Someone may
step out from between them, a vehicle door may open, or a vehicle may
pull out suddenly.
• Be careful when driving near motorcyclists or bicyclists. Always leave
plenty of room between your vehicle and any motorcyclists or bicyclists.
Know WhatIs Behind You
It is very important to check behind you before you:
• Change lanes. Look over your shoulder to make sure you are not getting
in the way of vehicles in the lane you want to enter.
• Reduce your speed. Take a quick look in your mirrors. Also, check your
mirrors when preparing to turn into a side road or driveway, and when
stopping to pull into a parking space.
• Drive down a long or steep hill. Watch for large vehicles because they
can gather speed very quickly.
• Back up. Backing up is always dangerous because it is hard to see
behind your vehicle. When you are backing out of a parking space:
— Check in front and behind the vehicle before you get in.
— Know where your kids are. Make sure they are away from your
vehicle and in full view before moving your vehicle.
– 44 –
— If other children are nearby, make sure you can see them before
backing up.
— Do not depend only on your mirrors or only looking out a side
window.
— Turn and look over your right and left shoulders before you
begin backing. As a safety measure, look over your right and left
shoulders again while backing.
— Back slowly to avoid collisions.
Check traffic behind you often to know if you are being tailgated (another
driver is following too closely). If you are being tailgated, be careful!
Brake slowly before stopping. Tap your brakes lightly a few times to warn
the tailgater you are slowing down. “Lose” the tailgater as soon as you
can. Change lanes and allow the tailgater to pass you, or slow down to
allow enough space between you and the car in front of you. If this does
not work, pull off the road when it is safe and let the tailgater pass.
How Well Can You Stop?
If something is in your path, you need to see it in time to stop. Assuming
you have good tires, brakes, and dry pavement:
• At 55 mph, it takes about 400 feet to react and bring your vehicle to a
complete stop.
• At 35 mph, it takes about 210 feet to react and bring your vehicle to a
complete stop.
Adjust your driving speed to the weather and road conditions (refer to the
“Basic Speed Law” in the “Speed Limits” section on page [37](#br49)). Turn
on your lights during the day, if it is hard to see or you cannot see at least
1,000 feet ahead of you.

LANE CONTROL
Line Colors
Solid yellow lines mark the center of
Exam ples of lane m arkings:
a road used for two-way traffic.
Broken yellow lines indicate that
you may pass if the broken line is
next to your driving lane.
Two solid yellow lines indicate no
passing. Never drive to the left of
these lines unless you are:
(1) Solid ye llow line: No passing if the
solid yellow line is on your side.
(2) Double solid lines: DO NOT pass.
• In a carpool lane/high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lane that has a
designated entrance on the left.
(3) Broken ye llow line: May pass if
movement can be made safely.
• Instructed by construction or other signs to drive on the other side of the
road because your side of the road is closed or blocked.
• Turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter or exit a
driveway or private road, or make a U-turn.
Two sets of solid double yellow lines
spaced 2 feet or more apart are
B
considered a barrier. Do not drive on
or over this barrier, make a left turn, or
a U-turn across it, except at designated
openings (see diagram).
Solid white lines mark traffic lanes going in the same direction, such as
one-way streets.
Broken white lines separate traffic lanes on roads with two or more lanes
in the same direction.
Double white lines are two solid white lines that indicate a lane barrier
between a regular use and a preferential use lane, such as a car pool/HOV.
Never change lanes while in these lanes; wait until a single broken white
line appears. You may also see these parallel lines in or near freeway on
and off ramps.
– 46 –
Choosing a Lane
Traffic lanes are often referred to
by number. The left or “fast” lane is
called the “Number 1 Lane.” The lane
to the right of the “Number 1 Lane”
is called the “Number 2 Lane,” and
then the “Number 3 Lane,” etc. Drive
Exam ple of num bered traﬃ c lanes:
in the lane with the smoothest flow of traffic. If you can choose among
three lanes, pick the middle lane for the smoothest driving. To drive faster,
pass, or turn left, use the left lane. When you choose to drive slowly, enter
or exit traffic on the right, turn right, park, or move off the road, use the
right lane. If there are only two lanes in your direction, pick the right lane
for the smoothest driving. Do not weave in and out of traffic. Stay in one
lane as much as possible. Once you start through an intersection, keep
going. If you start to make a turn, follow through. Last minute changes
may cause collisions. If you miss a turn, continue until you can safely and
legally turn around.
Changing Lanes
Changing lanes includes:
• Moving from one lane to another.
• Entering the freeway from an onramp.
• Entering the road from a curb or the shoulder.
Before changing lanes, signal, look in all your mirrors, and:
• Check traffic behind and beside you.
• Look over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move to make sure
the lane you want is clear.
• Check for vehicles, motorcyclists, and bicycle traffic in your blind spot.
• Be sure there is enough room for your vehicle in the next lane.
Passing Lanes
Before you pass, look ahead for road conditions and traffic that may cause
other vehicles to move into your lane. Never drive off the paved or main-
traveled portion of the road or on the shoulder to pass. The edge of the
main-traveled portion of the road may have a painted white line on the
road’s surface. Passing other vehicles at crossroads, railroad crossings,
and shopping center entrances is dangerous.
Pass traffic on the left. You may pass on the right only when:
– 47 –
• An open highway is clearly marked for two or more lanes of travel in
your direction.
• The driver ahead of you is turning left and you do not drive off the
roadway to pass. Never pass on the left if the driver is signaling a left
turn.
Carpool/High-Occupancy Vehicles (HOV) Lanes
An HOV lane is a special lane used only for carpools, buses,
motorcycles, or decaled low-emission vehicles. You may use
a carpool/HOV lane or onramp if your vehicle carries the
posted minimum number of people required for the carpool
lane, or you drive a low emission or a zero emission vehicle
displaying a special DMV-issued decal. If you operate a
low emission, zero emission, and/or hybrid vehicle, you
may be exempt from all toll charges on high occupancy
toll (HOT) lanes. Motorcyclists may use designated carpool/HOV lanes,
unless otherwise posted. Signs at the onramp or along the freeway tell you
the minimum number of people per vehicle required for the carpool/HOV
lane(s). These signs also list the days of the week and the hours when the
carpool/HOV requirement applies. The pavement in this lane is marked
with a diamond symbol and the words “Carpool Lane.” These lanes are
also known as HOV lanes. Do not cross over double parallel solid lines to
enter or exit any carpool/HOV lane except at designated entry or exit places.
Center Left Turn Lanes
A center left turn lane is located in
the middle of a two-way street and is
marked on both sides by two painted
lines. The inner line is broken and the
outer line is solid. If a street has a center
left turn lane, you must use it to prepare
for or make a left turn, or prepare for or make a permitted U-turn (CVC
§21460.5 (c)). You may only drive for 200 feet in the center left turn lane.
This lane is not a regular traffic lane or a passing lane. To turn left from
this lane, signal, look over your shoulder, and drive completely inside the
center left turn lane. Do not stop with the back of your vehicle blocking
traffic. Make sure the lane is clear in both directions and then turn only
when it is safe. Look for vehicles coming toward you in the same lane,
preparing to start their left turn. When turning left from a side street or
driveway, signal and wait until it is safe. Then you may drive into the
center left turn lane. Enter traffic only when it is safe.
– 48 –
Turnout Areas and Lanes
Special “turnout” areas are sometimes marked on two-lane
roads. Drive into these areas to allow cars behind you to pass.
Some two-lane roads have passing lanes. If you are driving
slowly on a two-lane highway or road where passing is unsafe,
and 5 or more vehicles are following, you must drive into the
turnout areas or lanes to let the vehicles pass.
End-of-Lane Markings
Freeway lanes, as well as some city street
lanes, which are ending will usually be
marked by large broken lines painted
on the pavement. If you are driving in a
lane marked with these broken lines, be
prepared to exit the freeway or the lane
to end. Look for a sign that tells you to
exit or merge, etc.
Yield Lines
Yield lines, also known as “shark’s teeth,” consist of a line
of solid white triangles across a lane of traffic pointing
towards approaching vehicles. This line indicates the
point where the vehicle must yield/stop.
Bicycle Lanes
A bicycle lane is a designated traffic lane
for bicyclists defined by pavement markings
and signage. Bicycle lanes are sometimes
painted a bright green color to increase
visibility. There are multiple classes and
types of bicycle lanes, including:
• Bike Lane
— Established along streets adjacent to
vehicle traffic, typically defined by a single solid white line that
turns into a dashed line near an intersection.
• Buffered Bike Lane
— Provides greater separation from the adjacent vehicle traffic, as
well as on-street parking, by using chevron or diagonal markings.
– 49 –
• Bike Route
— A designated preferred route for bicyclists on streets shared with
vehicle traffic, established by placing bike route signs and/or shared
roadway markings.
• Bicycle Boulevard
— A designated preferred route for bicyclists on streets shared with
vehicle traffic, intended to prioritize bicycle travel.
• Separated Bikeway
— Also known as a cycle track or protected bike lane, for the exclusive
use of bicyclists, and physically separated from vehicle traffic. The
separation may include flexible posts, grade separation, inflexible
barriers, or on-street parking.
• Shared Roadway Bicycle Markings (Sharrows)
— Alerts traffic that bicyclists are allowed
to occupy this travel lane. When used
appropriately, sharrows can also help
bicyclists to maintain a safe lane position.
It is illegal to drive in a bicycle lane unless parking (where permitted),
entering or leaving the roadway, or turning (within 200 feet of the
intersection). Drivers of motorized bicycles should use caution to avoid
bicyclists, and use bike lanes at a speed that is reasonable and does not
endanger the safety of bicyclists.
TURNS

Important: Keep your wheels pointed straight ahead until it is safe to
start your turn. If your wheels are pointed to the left and a vehicle hits you
from behind, you could be pushed into oncoming traffic. A left turn
against a red light can only be made from a one-way street onto a one-way
street. Signal and stop for a red traffic light at the marked limit line. If

in the right lane.
Public Transit Bus Lanes–It is illegal to drive, stop, park, or leave a
vehicle standing in the area of a road designated for the exclusive use of
public transit buses unless a vehicle must cross the lane to make a turn.
Signs will be posted to indicate the lanes are for “bus only” use.
Right turns against a red traffic signal light–Signal and stop for a
red traffic signal light at the marked limit line. If there is no limit line,
stop before entering the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, stop before
entering the intersection. You may turn right if there is no sign to prohibit
the turn. Yield to pedestrians, motorcyclists, bicyclists, or other vehicles
moving on their green traffic signal light.
Right turns onto a road with a dedicated
lane–You may make a right turn without
stopping if the road you are turning onto has
a nonmerging lane dedicated to right turning
vehicles, and there is no sign to prohibit a free
right turn. You may proceed without stopping,
even if there is a red traffic signal light located
within the island for vehicles proceeding straight through the intersection.
If there is a traffic signal light or sign on the right curb of the right turn

lane, you must follow the directions of that traffic signal light or sign.
Always yield to pedestrians within a crosswalk.
No turns against a red arrow–You may not turn right or left against a
red arrow.
Examples of Right and Left Turns
Numbers on the cars in the diagrams refer to numbered sentences on
these pages.
Always use your turn signals.
\1. Left turn from a two-way street. Start the
turn in the left lane closest to the middle

from another lane as shown by the graphic.
\3. Left turn from a two-way street into a
one-way street. Start the turn from the
lane closest to the middle of the street.
Turn into any lane that is safely open,

\5. Left turn from a one-way street into a one-way street. Start the turn
from the far left lane. Watch for pedestrians, motorcyclists, and
bicyclists between your vehicle and the curb because they can legally
use the left turn lane for their left turns. Turn into any lane that is safely
open, as shown by the arrows.

Legal U-Turns
A U-turn is turning your vehicle around in the street to go back the way
you came. To make a U-turn, signal and use the far left lane or the center
left turn lane. You may make a legal U-turn:
• Across a double yellow line when it is safe and legal.
• In a residential district:
— If there are no vehicles approaching you within 200 feet.
— Whenever a traffic sign, light, or traffic signal light protects you
from approaching vehicles.
• At an intersection on a green traffic signal light or green arrow, unless
a “No U-turn” sign is posted.
• On a divided highway, only if an opening is provided in the center
divider.

• Where a “No U-turn” sign is posted.
• When other vehicles may hit you.
• On a one-way street.
• In front of a fire station. Never use a fire station driveway to turn your
vehicle around.
• In business districts. Areas with churches, apartments, multifamily
housing units, and public buildings (except schools) are also considered
to be business districts. Turn only at an intersection, unless a sign
prohibits it, or where openings are provided for turns.

least 3 feet longer than your vehicle.
When you find a space, signal that
you intend to park.
\2. Pull your vehicle alongside the
space or vehicle in front of where
you intend to park. Leave
approximately 2 feet between the
vehicle or space next to you and stop
once your rear bumper is aligned to
the front of the space where you
want to park. Check your rearview mirror and look over your shoulder
for approaching vehicles. Keep your foot on the brake and put the
vehicle in reverse. Maintain the signal.
\3. Lift your foot off the brake. Before backing up, check your mirrors
and look over your shoulder for any hazards. Begin to back up, at
approximately a 45 degree angle.

Parking at Colored Curbs
Painted colored curbs have the following special parking rules:
White–Stop only long enough to pick up or drop off passengers or mail.
Green–Park for a limited time. Look
for a posted sign next to the green zone
for time limits, or locate the time limit
painted on the curb.
Yellow–Stop no longer than the time
posted to load or unload passengers
or freight. Drivers of noncommercial
vehicles are usually required to stay with
the vehicle.
Red–No stopping, standing, or parking (buses may stop at a red zone
marked for buses).
Blue–Parking is permitted only for a disabled person or driver
of a disabled person who displays a placard or special license
plate for disabled persons or disabled veterans. A crosshatched
(diagonal lines) area adjacent to a designated disabled parking
space is a no parking area. For information or an application for disabled
person parking placards or special plates, visit dmv.ca.gov or call
1-800-777-0133.
Example of crosshatched
(diagonal lines) area:
Note: Placard abuse results in the loss
of special parking privileges. It is also a
misdemeanor and punishable by a fine
of up to $ 1,000, imprisonment in county
jail for up to 6 months, or both.
Examples of disabled person placard/
plate abuse:
• Using a placard/plate after it has been reported lost or stolen without
reporting that the placard/plate was found.
• Loaning your placard/plate to friends or family members (disabled or
not).
• Interchanging placards with friends or family members.
– 58 –
• Using a placard/plate when the person it was issued to is not in the
vehicle with you (disabled child, family member, employer, etc.).
• Using a deceased person’s placard/plate.
Note: You must return the placard/plate of a deceased disabled person
to a DMV field office or mail to:

Illegal Parking
Never park or leave your vehicle:
• Where a “No Parking” sign is posted.
• On a marked or unmarked crosswalk, sidewalk, partially blocking a
sidewalk, or in front of a driveway.
• Within 3 feet of a sidewalk ramp for disabled persons or in front of or
on a curb that provides wheelchair access to a sidewalk.
• In a disabled person parking space, unless you are disabled and display
a placard or disabled person license plates.
• In the space next to a disabled person parking space, if it is painted in a
crosshatched (diagonal) pattern (CVC §22507.8(c)(2)).
• In a space designated for parking or fueling zero emission vehicles that

vehicle that you will charge in the space.
• In a tunnel or on a bridge, except where permitted by signs.
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant or fire station driveway.
• On or within 7½ feet of a railroad track.
• Between a safety zone and curb.
• “Double parked” (parking in the street when all legal parking places at
the curb are taken).
• On the wrong side of the street.
• At a red curb.

— In an emergency.
— When a peace officer or device requires a stop.
— Where a stop is specifically permitted.

Motorcyclists often use hand signals to make themselves more visible.
Bicyclists may give right turn signals with their right arm held straight
out, pointing right.
Signal:
• During the last 100 feet before reaching the turning point (left or right
turn).
• Before every lane change. Check your mirrors, look over your shoulder,
and check your blind spot before changing lanes.
• At least 5 seconds before you change lanes on a freeway.
• Before pulling next to the curb or away from the curb.
• When you change directions.
• Even when you do not see other vehicles. A vehicle you do not see may
suddenly appear and hit you.
• If you plan to turn beyond an intersection. Start signaling when you are
in the intersection. If you signal too early, the other driver may think
you plan to turn into the intersection and they may pull out in front of
you. Remember to cancel your signal after turning.
Steering
Recommendations for steering control and hand positions differ from
vehicle to vehicle based on the size, age, speed, and responsiveness of the
vehicle. While there is no one correct hand position or way to steer, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has provided
some basic guidelines.
Hand Position
If you think of the steering wheel as the face of a clock, place your hands
at 9 and 3 o’clock, or slightly lower at 8 and 4 o’clock. To reduce face,
arm, and hand injuries in the case of a deployed air bag, you should grip
the outside of the steering wheel, with your knuckles on the outside of the
wheel, and your thumbs stretched along the rim.
Controlling the Vehicle
There is no one correct way to steer a vehicle safely, but here are a few
steering methods recommended by NHTSA:
• Hand-to-Hand Steering– This steering method may also be called
“push/pull” steering. Using this steering method, your hands do not
cross over the face of the steering wheel; and therefore, there is less
chance of injury to your face, arms, or hands in the event of an air bag
– 61 –
deploying. When using this method, start with your hands at 9 and 3
o’clock, or slightly lower at 8 and 4 o’clock. Depending on the direction
you are turning, one hand will push the wheel up, and the opposite hand
pulls down.
• Hand-Over-Hand Steering– This method of steering can be used
when turning at low speeds, parking, or recovering from a skid. When
using this method, start with your hands at 9 and 3 o’clock, or slightly
lower at 8 and 4 o’clock. Depending on the direction you are turning,
one hand will push the wheel up, while the other hand will let go, reach
across the other arm, grasp the wheel, and pull up.
• One Hand Steering– NHTSA recommends using one-hand steering
only when turning while backing, or operating vehicle controls that
require removing a hand from the steering wheel. The only time that
a 12 o’clock hand position is recommended is when backing a vehicle
while turning, as the driver must turn in their seat to see the path of
the vehicle. The placement of hands on the wheel at 9 and 3 o’clock, or
slightly lower at 8 and 4 o’clock, is critical to vehicle balance.
Horn, Headlights, and Emergency Signals
Use YourHorn
• Only when necessary, to avoid collisions.
• To try to get “eye contact” with other drivers. You may tap your horn to
alert another driver who might turn in front of you and cause a collision.
• On narrow mountain roads, where you cannot see at least 200 feet ahead
of your vehicle.
Do NotUse YourHorn
• If a driver or bicyclist is moving slowly, and you want them to drive
faster or get out of your way. The driver or bicyclist may not be able to
safely go faster due to illness, being lost, intoxication, or mechanical
problems with the vehicle.
• To alert other drivers that they made a mistake. Your honking may cause
them to make more mistakes or become angry and retaliate.
• Because you may be angry or upset.
• To honk at pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists unless necessary to
avoid a collision. Remember that your horn sounds much louder outside
a vehicle.
Note: Honking your horn may startle other drivers. It is safer to slow
down or stop instead of honking your horn.
– 62 –
Use YourHeadlights
• If weather conditions require you to use your windshield wipers, you
are required to turn on your low-beam headlights.
• Any time conditions (clouds, rain, snow, dust, smoke, fog, etc.) prevent
you from seeing other vehicles.
• On small country or mountain roads, even on sunny days.
• In darkness and when visibility does not allow clear recognition of a
person or vehicle from a distance of 1,000 feet.
• When the vehicle is operated from 30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes
before sunrise.
• When a regulatory (white) road sign is posted stating headlights must
be on.
• To increase your vehicle’s visibility to others while driving – even on
bright days and especially when the sun is low on the horizon.
Use YourEm ergency Signals
If you can see a collision ahead, warn the drivers behind you by turning on
your emergency flashers or tapping your brake pedal quickly 3 or 4 times.
You can also use the hand signal when slowing and stopping.
Never stop on the road unless necessary for safety or to obey a law. If you
need to stop, start braking early as a signal to the cars behind you. If your
vehicle breaks down on the road, make sure that other drivers can see
it. If you experience vehicle trouble and need to stop, follow these rules:
• Pull off the road, away from all traffic, if possible.
• If you cannot get completely off the road, stop where people can see
you and your vehicle from behind. Do not stop just over a hill or just
around a curve.
• Turn on your emergency flashers if you are not moving. If your vehicle
doesn’t have emergency flashers, turn signals may be used instead.
• If it is safe, lift the hood to signal an emergency.
• Give other drivers plenty of warning. Place emergency flares or
triangles 200–300 feet behind the vehicle. This allows other drivers
time to change lanes, if necessary. Be very careful when using flares.
They may cause fires, especially when used near flammable liquids.
• If you do not have emergency flares, follow the rules listed above and
stay in your vehicle until help arrives. Be careful for your safety and
stay off the road.
– 63 –
Text Messaging and Cell Phones
It is illegal to drive a motor vehicle while using a cell phone or an
electronic wireless communication device to write, send, or read text
messages, instant messages, and emails unless you are 18 years old or
older and using a cell phone or an electronic wireless communications
device designed and configured to allow voice and hands-free operation
to dictate, send, or listen to text-based communications when operating
a vehicle. Although hands-free devices are permitted (except for minors),
drivers should minimize distractions to focus on safe driving practices.
• Call for help in emergencies only.
• If your cell phone rings, do not answer it. Let the call go to voicemail,
if you have this feature.
• If you must make a call, pull safely off the road before making the call.
• Keep telephone conversations short or, if possible, have a passenger
make the call.
• If you use your electronic wireless communications device:
— It must be mounted on the windshield, dashboard, or center console
of the vehicle.
— It cannot hinder your view of the road.
• Use a single swipe or touch on the mounted electronic device.
Do not use your cell phone:
• During hazardous conditions.
• To engage in distracting conversations.
Note: Minors may not use a cell phone or an electronic wireless
communications device except in certain emergencies (refer to the “Minors
and Cell Phones” section on page [16](#br28)[ ](#br28)for additional information).
– 64 –
HANDS OFF THE
MOBILE DEVICE
A driver’s mobile device must be mounted
on the windshield, dashboard, or center
console of the vehicle.
It can’t block a driver’s view of the road.
A driver may only use a single swipe or
touch on the mounted device.
It is against the law for minors to use a
hands-free device while driving.
VEHICLE POSITIONING
Following Distances
Suppose you are on a two-lane road with an oncoming vehicle approaching
and a bicyclist ahead to your right. Instead of driving between the vehicle
and the bicyclist, take one danger at a time. First, slow down and let the
oncoming vehicle pass. Then, when it is safe, move to the left to allow
plenty of room (at least 3 feet) to pass the bicyclist.
Persons Who Present Dangers to Drivers
Increase your following distance and allow a bigger space for drivers who
may be potentially dangerous. Persons who present dangers are:
• Drivers who cannot see you because their view is blocked by buildings,
trees, or other cars.
• Drivers backing out of driveways or parking spaces.
• Drivers who pass you when there is a curve or oncoming vehicle(s)
ahead.
• Drivers about to be forced into your lane to avoid a vehicle, pedestrian,
bicyclist, obstruction, or because of fewer lanes ahead.
• Pedestrians with umbrellas in front of their faces or hats pulled down
over their eyes.
• Distracted people, such as:
— Delivery persons.
— Construction workers.
— Distracted pedestrians, such as those talking or texting on their
electronic wireless communications device.
— Children, who often run into the street without looking.
— Drivers talking or texting on their electronic wireless
communications device or speaking to their passengers.
— Drivers taking care of children, eating, or looking at maps while
driving.
• Confused people, such as:
— Tourists, often at complicated intersections.
— Drivers who are looking for a house number or slow down for no
apparent reason.
– 66 –
Splitting the Difference
Sometimes there will be dangers on both sides of the road at the same
time. For example, there will be parked cars to the right and oncoming
cars to the left. In this case, the best thing to do is “split the difference.”
Steer a middle course between the oncoming cars and the parked cars.
If one danger is greater than the other, give the most room to the most
dangerous situation. Suppose there are oncoming cars on your left side
and a child on a bike on your right side. The child is more likely to make
a sudden move. Therefore, slow down and, if safe, use as much of your
lane to the left as possible until you pass the child.
Space to Merge
Enter the freeway at or near the speed of traffic. Do not stop before
merging into freeway traffic, unless it is absolutely necessary. Freeway
traffic has the right-of-way. When it is safe, follow the “3-second rule”
(refer to the “Do not be a tailgater!” section on page [43](#br55)).
• Do not try to merge into a gap that is too small.
• Watch for vehicles around you. Use your mirrors and turn signals. Turn
your head to look quickly over your shoulder before changing lanes
or merging in traffic. Leave 3 seconds of space between you and the
vehicle ahead of you. Make sure you can stop safely, if necessary.
• If you need to cross several freeway lanes, cross them one at a time. If
you wait until all of the lanes are clear, you may cause traffic delays or
a collision.
Space to Cross or Enter
When crossing or entering city or highway traffic from a full stop, signal,
and leave a large enough gap to get up to the speed of other vehicles.
You must share the space with traffic already on the road. It is important
to know how much space you need for merging, crossing, entering, and
exiting out of traffic. You need a gap that is about:
• Half a block on city streets.
• A full block on the highway.
If you are crossing lanes or turning, make sure there are no vehicles or
people blocking the path ahead or to the sides of your vehicle. You do not
want to be caught in an intersection with traffic coming at you.
Even if you have the green traffic signal light, do not start across the
intersection if there are vehicles blocking your way.
– 67 –
When turning left, do not start the turn just because an approaching
vehicle has its right turn signal on. The driver may plan to turn just beyond
you, or the signal may have been left on from an earlier turn. This is
particularly true of motorcycles. Their signal lights often do not turn off
automatically. Wait until the other driver actually starts to turn before
you continue.
Space to Exit
When you plan to exit the freeway, give yourself plenty of time. You
should know the name or number of the freeway exit you want, as well as
the one that comes before it. To exit safely:
• Signal, look over your shoulder, and change lanes one at a time until you
are in the proper lane to exit the freeway.
• Signal your intention to exit for approximately 5 seconds before reaching
the exit.
• Be sure you are at the proper speed for leaving the traffic lane–not too
fast (so you remain in control) and not too slow (so the flow of traffic
can still move freely).
Passing
When Approaching to Pass
Before you pass, look ahead for road conditions and traffic that may cause
other vehicles to move into your lane. Only pass when safe to do so.
You must judge whether you have enough room to pass whenever you
approach:
• An oncoming vehicle.
• A hill or curve.
• An intersection.
• A road obstruction.
• A bicyclist.
Do not pass:
• If you are approaching a hill or curve and cannot see if other traffic is
approaching.
• Within 100 feet of an intersection, bridge, tunnel, railroad crossing, or
area that could cause concern.
– 68 –
How to pass:
Never drive off the paved or main-traveled portion of the road or on the
shoulder to pass. The edge of the main-traveled portion of the road may
have a painted white line on the road’s surface. Passing other vehicles at
crossroads, railroad crossings, and driveways is dangerous.
Pass traffic on the left. You may pass on the right only when:
• An open highway is clearly marked for 2 or more lanes of travel in your
direction.
• The driver ahead of you is turning left and you do not drive off the
roadway to pass. Never pass on the left if the driver is signaling a left
turn.
• On a one-way street.
Always signal before passing. You may also lightly tap your horn, or
briefly flash your lights, to let the other driver know you intend to pass.
Do not pull out to pass unless you know you have enough space to pull
back into your lane.
Avoid passing other vehicles, including motorcycles and bicycles, on two-
lane roads. Every time you pass, you increase your chances of having a
collision. When you pass a bicyclist, slow down and pass the bicyclist only
when safe, allowing for a minimum of 3 feet between your vehicle and the
bicyclist where possible. Do not squeeze the bicyclist off the road.
Returning to a Lane AfterPassing
Before you return to your driving lane, be sure you are not dangerously
close to the vehicle you have just passed. One way to do this is to look
for the vehicle in your inside rearview mirror. When you can see both
headlights in your rearview mirror, you may have enough room to return
to your driving lane. Do not count on having enough time to pass several
vehicles at once or that other drivers will make room for you.
Being Passed
If a vehicle is passing you, or has signaled intent to pass, you should avoid
accelerating and maintain your lane position to allow the vehicle to pass
you. Do not accelerate or try to go faster to avoid being passed.
– 69 –
SHARING THE ROAD
Large Trucks (Big Rigs) and Recreational
Vehicles (RVs)
To reduce the chance of having a collision with a large truck or RV,
you must be familiar with a big rig’s physical capabilities and how it
maneuvers.
Braking
Large trucks take longer to stop than passenger vehicles traveling at the
same speed. The average passenger vehicle traveling at 55 mph can stop
within 400 feet. However, a large truck traveling at the same speed can
take almost 800 feet to stop. Do not move in front of a large truck and
suddenly slow down or stop. The truck driver will not be able to stop
quickly enough to avoid crashing into you.
Trucker’s Blind Spots—the “No Zone”
Passenger vehicle drivers incorrectly
assume that a trucker can see the
road better because they are higher
off the road. While truckers do have
a better forward view and bigger
mirrors, they still have large blind
spots or “NO ZONES” where your
vehicle can disappear from a truck
driver’s view.
Shaded areas are the driver’s blind
spots.
If you stay in those blind spots, you
block the trucker’s ability to take evasive action to avoid a dangerous
situation. Generally speaking, if you cannot see the truck driver in their
side mirror, they cannot see you.
Turning
When a vehicle makes a turn, the rear wheels follow a shorter path than
the front wheels. The longer the vehicle, the greater the difference in
the turning path. This is why big rig drivers must often swing wide to
complete a right turn. When you follow a big rig, look at its turn signals
before you start to pass. If the truck appears to be turning left, check
the turn signals again; the driver may actually be turning right but first
swinging wide.
– 70 –
Maneuverabil ity
Trucks are not as maneuverable as passenger vehicles. Large trucks have
longer stopping and starting distances. They take more space for turns
and weigh more. When no signs are posted, these vehicles must be driven
in the right traffic lane or as close as possible to the right edge of the
roadway.
On a divided highway with 4 or more traffic lanes in one direction, these
vehicles may also be driven in the lane just to the left of the right lane.
Avoid these mistakes when driving around large trucks:
• Cutting off a truck in traffic or on the highway to reach an exit
or turn. Cutting into the open space in front of a truck is dangerous.
Slow down and take your turn entering the construction zone. Do not
speed up to pass a truck, so you can exit the roadway. Take a moment
to slow down and exit behind a truck.
• Lingering alongside a truck when passing. Always pass a large truck
on the left side, and after you pass the truck, move ahead of it. Do not
linger. Otherwise, you make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the
trucker to take evasive action if an obstacle appears in the road ahead.
• Following too closely or tailgating. When you follow so closely
behind a truck that you cannot see the truck driver’s side view mirrors,
the trucker cannot see you and has no way of knowing you are there.
Tailgating a truck, or any vehicle, is dangerous because you decrease
your own safety distance if the vehicle in front of you stops quickly.
• Underestimating the size and speed of an approaching tractor-
trailer. A large tractor-trailer often appears to be traveling at a slower
speed because of its large size. Many collisions involving a passenger
vehicle and large truck occur at intersections, when the passenger
vehicle’s driver did not realize how close the truck was or how fast it
was traveling.
Buses, Streetcars, and Trolleys
Do not drive through a safety zone, which is a space set aside for
pedestrians, marked by raised buttons or markers on a roadway. When
people are boarding or leaving a streetcar or trolley where there is no
safety zone, stop behind the vehicle’s nearest door or vehicle platform and
wait until the people have reached a safe place. When a bus, streetcar, or
trolley is stopped at a safety zone or at an intersection where traffic is
controlled by a peace officer or traffic signal light, you may pass at no
more than 10 mph.
– 72 –
Do not overtake and pass any light-rail vehicle or streetcar on the left side,
whether it is moving or standing.
Exceptions:
• When you are on a one-way street.
• When the tracks are so close to the right side that you cannot pass on
the right.
• When a traffic officer directs you to pass on the left.
Light-Rail Vehicles

Note: Light-rail vehicles can interrupt
traffic signal lights. Do not proceed
until the traffic signal light indicates
you may proceed.
– 73 –
Emergency Vehicles
You must yield the right-of-way
to any police vehicle, fire engine,
ambulance, or other emergency
vehicle using a siren and red lights.
Drive to the right edge of the road and
stop until the emergency vehicle(s)
have passed. However, never stop in

an intersection. If you are in an intersection when you see an emergency
vehicle, continue through the intersection, and then drive to the right as
soon as it is safe and stop. Emergency vehicles often use the wrong side
of the street to continue on their way. They sometimes use a loudspeaker
to talk to drivers blocking their path.
You must obey any traffic direction, order, or signal given by a traffic
or peace officer, or a firefighter even if it conflicts with existing signs,
signals, or laws.
It is against the law to follow within 300 feet behind any fire engine,
police vehicle, ambulance, or other emergency vehicle with a siren or
flashing lights (CVC §21706).
If you drive for sight-seeing purposes to the scene of a fire, collision, or
other disaster, you may be arrested. Casual observers interfere with the
essential services of police, firefighter, ambulance crews, or other rescue
or emergency personnel.
Slow-Moving Vehicles
Some vehicles are not designed to
keep up with the speed of traffic.
Farm tractors, animal-drawn carts,
and road maintenance vehicles
usually travel 25 mph or less. Slow-
moving vehicles have an orange/red
A Slow-Moving Vehicle
triangle on the back of the vehicles. It
looks like the sign in the picture to the right. Look for these vehicles and
adjust your speed before you reach them.
Also, be aware that large trucks, bicyclists, and small-underpowered cars
lose speed on long or steep hills and take longer to get up to speed when
entering traffic.
– 74 –
Other types of slow-moving motorized vehicles, such as wheelchairs, scooters,
neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and golf carts may legally operate on
public roads. Adjust your speed accordingly to accommodate them.
Vehicles proceeding at a speed less than the flow of traffic and moving on
a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe, must turn off the roadway at
the nearest place designated as a turnout or wherever sufficient area for
a safe turnout exists, if a line of 5 or more vehicles forms behind them.
Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV) and Low-
Speed Vehicles (LSV)
When you see these signs or markings: NEV USE ONLY or NEV
ROUTE, watch out for slow-moving vehicles in the roadway. NEVs and
LSVs are restricted from roadways where the speed limit is greater than
35 mph (CVC §§385.5 and 21260). NEVs and LSVs reach a maximum
speed of 25 mph. Owners of registered NEVs and LSVs must comply with
financial responsibility laws and have a valid DL to operate the vehicle.
Animal-Drawn Vehicles
Horse-drawn vehicles and riders of horses or other animals are entitled to
share the road with motor vehicles. It is a traffic offense to scare horses or
stampede livestock. Slow down or stop, if necessary, or when requested
to do so by the riders or herders.
Motorcycles
Motorcyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as automobile
drivers. While everyone must follow the same traffic laws, motorcyclists
face additional dangers because motorcycles require exceptional handling
ability and are harder to see. Therefore, many motorcyclists keep their
headlight(s) on at all times, even during daylight hours.
Motorcyclists can do many things to increase their chances of being seen
by drivers and other road users, including:
• Wearing a bright-colored jacket, vest, and helmet.
• Wearing reflective material on helmets and clothes.
• Always using turn signals when planning to change lanes or turn.
• Flashing their brake lights before slowing down to help others notice
the motorcycle.
• Avoiding blind spots of other vehicles and not lingering between
vehicles when lane splitting.
• Using high beam headlights during daylight hours.
– 75 –
Follow these rules to respect the right-of-way and safely share the road
with motorcyclists:
• When you change lanes or enter a major thoroughfare, make a visual
check in addition to using your mirrors. Motorcycles are small and can
easily disappear into a vehicle’s blind spots.
• Allow a 4 second following distance. If the motorcyclist brakes suddenly
or falls off the motorcycle, you will need this space to avoid hitting
them.
• Whenever possible, allow the motorcycle a full lane width. Although
it is not illegal to share lanes with motorcycles, it can potentially be
unsafe.
• Never try to pass a motorcycle in the same lane you are sharing with
them.
• Whenever possible, move to one side of your lane to give motorcyclists
ample room to pass.
• When you make a turn, check for motorcyclists and gauge their speed
before turning to avoid a possible collision.
• Look carefully for motorcyclists before opening doors next to moving
traffic or before turning right.
• Different road conditions, like potholes, gravel, wet or slippery surfaces,
pavement seams, railroad crossings, and grooved pavement, can cause
motorcyclists to change speed or direction suddenly. If you are aware of
the effect of these conditions and drive with care and attention, you can
help reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities. For more information
regarding motorcycle safety, visit the California Motorcyclist Safety
Program at [chp.ca.gov/programs-services/programs/california](https://chp.ca.gov/programs-services/programs/california)-

Bicycles
Bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as vehicle and
motorcycle drivers, including:
• Obeying all traffic signs and signal lights.
• Riding in the same direction as traffic.
• Signaling when changing lanes or turning.
• Yielding to pedestrians.
• Wearing a helmet (if under 18 years old).
• Allowing faster traffic to pass when safe.
• Staying visible (for example, never weave between parked vehicles).
• Riding as near to the right curb or edge of the roadway as practicable.
– 76 –
• Not riding on the sidewalk, unless allowed by the city where you’re
riding.
• Making left and right turns in the same way drivers do, using the same
turn lanes. If the bicyclist is traveling straight ahead, they should use a
through traffic lane rather than ride next to the curb and block traffic
making right turns.
Bicyclists shall not operate a bicycle on a roadway unless the bicycle is
equipped with a brake, which will enable the operator to make a one-
wheel skid on dry, level, clean pavement.
During darkness, bicyclists should avoid
Turns for bicyclists:
wearing dark clothing and must have the
following equipment:
• A front lamp emitting a white light
visible from a distance of 300 feet.
• A rear red reflector or a solid or
flashing red light with a built in
reflector that is visible from a distance
of 500 feet.
Intersections with sp eciallanes:
• A white or yellow reflector on each
pedal or the bicyclist’s shoes or ankles
visible from a distance of 200 feet.
• A white or yellow reflector on the front
wheel, white or red reflector on the
rear wheel, or reflectorized tires.
Bicyclists have the right to operate on the road and may:
• Lawfully be permitted to ride on certain sections of freeways where
there is no alternate route and bicycling is not forbidden by a sign.
• Move left to avoid hazards such as parked or moving vehicles, bicycles,
animals, or debris.
• Choose to ride near the left curb or edge of a one-way street.
Bicycles in Travel Lanes
Bicyclists traveling slower than the flow of traffic must ride as close as
practicable to the right curb or edge of the roadway except in the following
situations:
• Passing a vehicle or another bicycle in the same direction.
• Preparing to make a left turn at an intersection, into a private road, or
at a driveway.
– 77 –
• When necessary to avoid a hazard
or road condition (for example,
pedestrians, animals, or surface
hazards).
Right
Wrong
• When a lane is too narrow for a bicycle
and vehicle to travel safely side-by-side
within the lane.
• When approaching a right turn.
• If the roadway is a one-way road with
two or more lanes. In this case, a bicyclist may ride near the left curb
or edge of roadway as practicable. With any slow-moving vehicle or
bicycle, drivers should follow at a safe distance and, when it is safe, the
bicyclist should move to a position that allows vehicles to pass.
Passing a bicyclist that is in the travel lane at a safe distance may require
changing into another lane, passing safely and quickly, and returning
to your original lane while leaving room between your vehicle and the
bicyclist. When you cannot change lanes to pass a bicyclist, allow at least
3 feet between your vehicle and the bicyclist. If you are unable to pass
within 3 feet of space, pass at a safe speed to not endanger the bicyclist.
Here are some critical points for drivers and bicyclists to remember. Motor
vehicle drivers must:
• Pass bicyclists allowing enough room to avoid forcing them
into parked vehicles or doors that are open into traffic.
• Merge toward the curb or into the bike lane only when it
is safe.
• Merge safely behind a bicyclist when preparing to make a
turn.
• Only enter a bike lane no more than 200 feet before starting a turn.
• Make a visual check for bicyclists when changing lanes or entering
traffic. Bicycles are small and may be hidden in a vehicle’s blind spot.
• Be careful when approaching or passing a bicyclist on a two-lane
roadway.
– 78 –
Slow down
and stop.
Every intersection is a
crosswalk.
California has the nation’s highest number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities.
When you drive, take extra care around people walking and biking. It’s the
human thing to do.
Look twice for people walking or biking before you make a turn. Always
come to a complete stop before making a right turn on red.
Stop for people in crosswalks. Every intersection is a crosswalk, even if it’s
unmarked.
If another car is stopped at a crosswalk, you should stop, too. There may be
someone crossing that you can’t see.
Pedestrians Who Are Blind
Pedestrians using guide dogs or white canes with or without a red tip must
be given the right-of-way at all times. These pedestrians are partially or
totally blind. When these pedestrians are in your vicinity, be especially
careful when turning corners or backing up, particularly if you are driving
a quiet hybrid vehicle.
Here are some suggestions for helping pedestrians who are blind:
• At a stop light or sign, do not stop your vehicle more than 5 feet
from the crosswalk, unless there is an advance stop bar (line). Blind
pedestrians rely on the sound of your vehicle to become aware of your
vehicle’s presence; therefore, it is important that you stop your vehicle
within 5 feet of the crosswalk. Drivers of hybrid or electric vehicles
must remain especially aware that the lack of engine or electric motor
noise may cause a blind pedestrian to assume there is not a vehicle
nearby. Follow this cue: When a blind person pulls in their cane and
steps away from the intersection, this gesture usually means they are
not ready to cross the street and for you to go.
• Stop at all crosswalks where pedestrians are waiting. Wait for the
pedestrian to cross the street.
• Do not stop in the middle of a crosswalk. This forces the blind
pedestrian to go around your vehicle and into traffic outside of the
crosswalk.
• Do not give the blind pedestrian verbal directions. A blind pedestrian
listens to all traffic sounds before deciding to cross the street.
• Do not turn right without looking first. Look for any pedestrians,
especially blind pedestrians or traffic, before starting your turn. Blind
pedestrians who have a green light are not expecting a driver to make
a right turn in front of them. Turning may result in the blind pedestrian
becoming disoriented and vulnerable to being hit by another right
turning vehicle when attempting to cross the street.
• Do not honk your horn at a blind person. The blind person has no idea
who you are honking at and may be startled by the noise.
• Do not block any sidewalk.

Road Workers and Work Zones (Cone Zones)
Signs and message boards warn you of workers, slow-
moving equipment, and closed lanes ahead. Cones, drums,
or other barriers will guide you through the work zone.
Reduce your speed and be prepared to slow down or stop
for highway equipment. Merge as soon as it is safe to do so
without crossing the cones or drums. In work zones where lanes are
narrow or where the shoulder is closed, watch for bicycles when they are
present and “share the road.” Watch for work zone speed limit and reduced
speed limit warning signs.
For your own safety and the safety of your passengers
remember to pass the work zone carefully, slow down, allow
extra following room between vehicles, merge early, expect
sudden slowing or stopping, watch for drivers changing
lanes at the last minute, and avoid distractions while driving
in a work zone. Distractions include using your hands-free
cell phone, reading/sending text messages, and/or operating
your GPS and entertainment systems. Fines for traffic violations in a work
zone can be  $1,000 or more. Anyone convicted of assaulting a highway
worker faces fines of up to $ 2,000 and imprisonment for up to 1 year.
Do not stop or slow down to watch the road work. Obey special signs or
instructions from workers (flaggers).
Double Fine Zones
Due to increased collision-related injuries and fatalities, certain roads
are designated as “Safety Enhanced-Double Fine Zones.” Fines for
violations are doubled in these zones and also in highway construction or
maintenance zones when workers are present (CVC §42010).
Move Over and Slow Down
Drivers are required to move over a lane, if safe to do so, or slow down
when approaching a stationary emergency vehicle or tow truck displaying
flashing amber warning lights, or a Department of Transportation
(Caltrans) vehicle displaying emergency flashing or amber warning
lights while stopped on the side of a state highway or freeway. The law
is designed to reduce the deaths of peace officers, tow truck drivers,
paramedics, Caltrans employees, and other emergency personnel who are
aiding stranded or injured motorists or involved in road work.
– 82 –
Vehicles with Hazardous Loads
A diamond-shaped sign on a truck Hazardous Load Placards
means that the load on the truck
is potentially dangerous (gas,
explosives, etc.). Vehicles that
display these signs are required to
stop before crossing railroad tracks.
Dealing with Traffic Congestion
Small changes in your driving habits can help relieve chronic traffic
congestion.
Avoid the following driving behaviors:
• Tailgating–following too closely.
• Unnecessary lane changes–weaving in and out of freeway lanes.
• Inattention–eating, grooming, talking on a cell phone, text messaging,
reading the newspaper, etc.
• Operating a poorly-maintained or malfunctioning vehicle or
running out of fuel or battery charge.
Dealing with Aggressive Drivers and Road Rage
Aggressive driving can cause many serious problems on the roadway. All
drivers must be aware of both aggressive driving and the behavior known
as “road rage,” and what to do when they occur.
There are 2 important things to be aware of regarding aggressive
drivers:
\1. Recognizing and avoiding the behaviors in yourself.
\2. Avoiding other drivers engaging in these behaviors.
Ways to avoid becoming an aggressive driver include:
• Allow plenty of time to reach your destination.
• Do not “cut off” other drivers.
• Do not drive slowly in the left (fast) lane.
• Do not tailgate.
• Do not gesture to other drivers.
• Use your horn for emergencies only.
• Let aggressive drivers pass you.
– 83 –
The following are examples of common behaviors that can lead to
aggressive driving and how to avoid them:
• Lane Blocking–Do not block the passing lane. Stay out of the far left
lane if other traffic wants to drive faster, and yield to the right for any
vehicle that wants to pass.
• Tailgating–Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. If
you are being tailgated, leave more space between you and the vehicle
in front of you.
• Signal Lights–Always use your signals when changing lanes, and avoid
changing lanes too close to the other vehicles. After you have changed
lanes, turn your signal off.
• Gestures–If you must gesture to another driver, do so in a way that will
not be interpreted as hostile or obscene.
• Failure to Turn–Unless otherwise posted, right turns are allowed after
a complete stop at a red light. Choosing to wait for the green light may
frustrate the drivers behind you, but is not illegal.
• Parking–Do not take more than one parking space. Do not park in the
disabled parking space if you do not have a disabled person parking
placard or plates.
• Headlights–If you use your high-beam headlights, dim your lights for
oncoming traffic and when approaching a vehicle from behind; do not
retaliate to oncoming high beams with your own.
• Merging–When traffic permits, make room to allow vehicles to merge
into your lane.
SPECIAL DRIVING SITUATIONS
Keep Your Car Visible
The driver’s blind spots are shown in the graphic on page [70](#br82). If you
look only in your mirrors, you cannot see vehicles in these blind spots.
Turn your head to see if a vehicle is in one of these blind spots. Do not
linger in another driver’s blind spot. As soon as you can, drop back or
pass the vehicle.
What is the Road Condition
The faster your speed, the less control you have of your vehicle. Rather
than driving at the legal posted speed limit, adjust your driving speed for
road conditions or whatever affects the safe operation of your vehicle.
– 84 –
Curves
On curves, there is a strong outward pull on your vehicle, which is especially
dangerous when the road is slippery. Rain, mud, snow, ice, and gravel make
the road slippery. If a speed limit is not posted before a curve, you must
judge how sharp the curve is and adjust your speed accordingly. Slow down
before you enter the curve; you do not know what may be ahead (stalled
vehicle, collision, etc.). Braking on a curve may cause you to skid.
Traffic Speeds
Collisions are more likely to happen when one driver goes faster or slower
than the other vehicles on the road. If you drive faster than other traffic,
you increase your chances of being involved in a collision. Speeding
does not save much time. Driving slower than other vehicles or stopping
suddenly can be just as dangerous as speeding, if not more dangerous,
because you may cause a rear-end collision or cause other drivers to
swerve to avoid hitting your vehicle. If you are in the fast lane and notice
vehicles moving to the right lane to pass you, or a line of vehicles forming
behind you, the best thing to do is move into the right lane when safe, and
let the vehicle(s) pass.
Driving Hazards
Wateron the Road
Slow down when there is a lot of water on the road. In a heavy rain at
speeds of 50 mph or more, your tires can lose all contact with the road
and then your vehicle will be riding on water or “hydroplaning.” A slight
change of direction, applying the brakes, or a gust of wind could throw
your vehicle into a skid.
If your vehicle starts to hydroplane, slow down gradually—do not apply
the brakes.
Slippery Roads
Slow down at the first sign of rain, especially after a dry spell. This is when
many roads are the most slippery, because oil and dust have not washed
away. A slippery road will not give your tires the grip they need. Drive
more slowly than you would on a dry road. Adjust your speed as follows:
• Wet road–Go 5 to 10 mph slower.
• Packed snow–Reduce your speed by half.
• Ice–Slow to a crawl.
– 85 –
Some road surfaces are more slippery than others when wet and usually
have warning signs posted. Here are some clues to help you spot slippery
roads:
• On cold, wet days, shade from trees or buildings can hide spots of ice.
These areas freeze first and dry out last.
• Bridges and overpasses tend to freeze before the rest of the road does.
They can hide spots of ice.
• If it starts to rain on a hot day, the pavement can be very slippery for
the first several minutes. Heat causes oil in the asphalt to come to the
surface. The oil makes the road slippery until the rain washes the oil
off the surface of the road.
High Winds
High winds can be a hazard while driving, especially to larger vehicles,
such as trucks, campers, and vehicles with trailers. Some precautions for
driving in high winds include:
• Reducing your speed. Slowing down gives you better control over the
vehicle and will give you more time to react in the event your vehicle
gets hit by a strong gust of wind.
• Maintaining a firm hand position on the steering wheel. Strong wind
gusts are unpredictable, and if you are not holding the wheel properly,
gusts can be strong enough to cause the steering wheel to be jerked out
of your hands.
• Being alert. Look well ahead and watch for any debris on the road.
High winds can cause debris to litter the highway or can even throw
debris directly into your path. By looking ahead, you give yourself more
time to react to road hazards.
• Not using cruise control. You can maintain maximum control of the
accelerator (gas) pedal when unpredictable gusts of wind occur.
• Being proactive. Wait for the storm to blow over. It may be safer to pull
over and take a break.
Driving in Fog orHeavy Sm oke
The best advice for driving in the fog or heavy smoke is DON’T. Yo u
should consider postponing your trip until the fog clears. However, if
you must drive, then drive slow, turn on your windshield wipers, and use
your low-beam headlights. The light from the high-beam headlights will
reflect back and cause glare.
Never drive with just your parking or fog lights.
– 86 –
Increase your following distance and be prepared to stop within the
space you can see ahead. Avoid crossing or passing lanes of traffic unless
absolutely necessary. Listen for traffic you cannot see. Use your wipers
and defroster as necessary for best vision.
If the fog becomes so thick that you can barely see, consider pulling off
the roadway, activating your emergency signal lights, and waiting until
the weather improves before continuing.
Driving With Sun Glare
Glare from the sun can be very dangerous while driving. The following
tips may help you manage sun glare:
• Keep the inside and outside of your windshield clean.
• Make sure your windshield wipers are in good working order and your
wiper fluid level is full.
• Wear polarized sunglasses.
• Maintain enough space between your vehicle and the vehicles around
you. Your car visor should also be free of anything that would restrict
use and be in good working order.
• Be extra cautious of pedestrians. Yo u may have difficulty seeing them.
• Try to avoid driving during sunrise and sunset.
Driving in Darkness
Night driving is more difficult and hazardous than daytime driving. Make
sure you can stop within the distance lighted by your headlights. Use your
low-beam headlights at night when it rains. Do not drive using only your
parking lights.
Use your high-beam headlights whenever possible in open country or
dark city streets, as long as it is not illegal. Do not blind the driver of an
oncoming vehicle with your high-beam headlights. Dim your lights when
necessary. If another vehicle’s lights are bright:
• Do not look directly into the oncoming headlights.
• Look toward the right edge of your lane.
• Watch the oncoming vehicle out of the corner of your eye.
• Do not try to “get back” at the other driver by keeping your bright lights
on. If you do, both of you may be blinded.
When you drive at night, remember:
• Pedestrians and bicyclists are much harder to see at night; stay alert for
them.
– 87 –
• Motorcycles are also harder to see at night because most have only one
taillight.
• Highway construction can take place at night. Reduce your speed in
highway construction zones.
• When you leave a brightly-lit place, drive slowly until your eyes adjust
to the darkness.
• When a vehicle with one light drives toward you, drive as far to the right
as possible. It could be a bicyclist or motorcyclist, but it could also be a
vehicle with a missing headlight.
Driving in Rain orSnow
Many road pavements are the most slippery when it first starts to rain or
snow because oil and dust have not yet washed away. Slow down at the
first sign of rain, drizzle, or snow on the road. Turn on your windshield
wipers, low-beam headlights, and defroster. In a heavy rainstorm or
snowstorm, you may not be able to see more than 100 feet ahead of your
vehicle. When you cannot see any farther than 100 feet, you cannot safely
drive faster than 30 mph. You may have to stop from time to time to wipe
mud or snow off your windshield, headlights, and taillights. If you drive
in snowy areas, carry the correct number of chains and be sure they will
fit your drive wheels. Learn how to put the chains on before you need to
use them.
Flooded Roadways
Excessive water on a roadway may cause flooding. This can happen
gradually or suddenly. Flooding is dangerous and can be life threatening.
It is important to understand the risks of water on the roadway. Some of
the dangers of a flooded roadway include:
• The vehicle being swept off the road.
• Floating debris and unseen hazards.
• The roadway collapsing.
• Vehicle malfunction (for example, brake failure).
• Electrocution if accompanied by fallen power lines.
It is best to find an alternate route if you encounter a flooded roadway.
It may not be possible to determine the depth of the flood by looking; it
may be deep and too dangerous to cross. If you have no other option but
to drive through a flooded roadway, be sure to drive slowly. Once you
have safely navigated through the water, slowly and carefully check your
brakes to ensure that they function correctly.
– 88 –
Driving in Hill Country orCurves
You never know what is on the other side of a steep hill or a sharp curve.
When you come to a hill or curve, slow down so you can stop for any
hazard. You must drive slowly enough to stop.
Any time your view is blocked by a hill or a curve, assume there is another
vehicle ahead of you. Only pass the vehicle if a hill or curve is at least ⅓
of a mile away, because you need at least that much room to pass safely.
Do not drive on the left side of the road when coming to a curve or the
top of a hill, because you cannot see far enough ahead to know if it is safe
to pass.
Traffic Breaks
Traffic breaks are used by law enforcement to:
• Slow or stop traffic to remove hazards from the roadway.
• Conduct emergency operations.
• Prevent traffic collisions in heavy fog or unusually heavy traffic.
During a traffic break, the officer turns the rear emergency lights on,
slows the vehicle, and drives across the lanes of traffic in a serpentine
manner. To assist the officer in conducting a traffic break:
• Activate your emergency flashers to warn other drivers there is a hazard
ahead.
• Slowly begin to decrease your speed. Do not slow abruptly unless it is
necessary to avoid a collision. Slow to the same speed as the officer
while keeping a safe distance from the patrol vehicle ahead of you.
• Do not attempt to drive past the patrol vehicle. Do not accelerate
until the patrol vehicle has turned off its emergency lights and traffic
conditions ahead allow the traffic to return to normal speeds.
Clean Windows and Mirrors
Keep your mirrors, windshield, and side windows clean inside and outside.
Bright sun or headlights on a dirty window make it hard to see out. Clear
off ice, frost, or dew from all windows before you drive.
If you drive in rain or snow, you may have to stop to remove mud or snow
off your windshield, mirrors, headlights, and taillights.
– 89 –
Adjust Seat and Mirrors
Adjust your seat before you put on your seat belt. Yo u should sit high
enough to see the road. Adjust your rear and side view mirrors before you
start driving. If your vehicle has a day/night mirror, learn how to use it.
The night setting reduces the headlight glare from the cars behind you
and helps you see well.
Tire Safety
Tires are an important part of driving
safety. Here are a few simple tips to
help you maintain your tires:
• Look for any tears or bulges on
the sidewall of the tire, check the
tread depth, and ensure your tire
pressure is within the proper range
by referring to the owner’s manual
or the pounds per square inch (PSI)
If you can see the top of Lincoln’s
indicator within the inside edge of head, it’s tim e for new tires.
the vehicle door.
• You can use a penny to check the tread on your tire.
— Hold the penny so you can see Abraham Lincoln’s head. You should
hold the coin between your fingers so his head is facing you and
completely visible.
— Place the coin, with the head pointing down, into the deepest
groove of your tire tread. If his head is completely visible, your
tires need to be replaced.
Green Driving
Green driving, or “smart” driving, is a set of activities and techniques
that maximize vehicle fuel efficiency and lower emissions by improving
driving habits and keeping up with vehicle maintenance. According to
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “…the transportation
sector generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions.”
The following are a few easy-to-remember activities that you can use for
green driving:
• Behavior–Accelerate and slow down smoothly, and maintain a steady
average speed.
• Maintenance–Keep your vehicle in good shape by regularly inflating
tires, getting oil changes, and checking filters.
– 90 –
T. I.R.E. Tips
T. Tread
Place an upside down penny in
the tire tread. If you can see all of
Lincoln’s head, the tread is too low
and you need a new tire.
I. Inflate
Check air pressure once a month.
Low tire pressure can cause tire wear
and poor gas mileage.
R. Rotate
Rotate your tires every 3,000–5,000
miles to increase tire tread life.
E. Evaluate
Evaluate your tires everyday for any
abnormal wear, cracks, and nails.
A few minutes a month is all
it takes to be tire safe.
– 91 –
• Weight–Get rid of extra weight in your vehicle by clearing out the
trunk, or removing luggage racks from the roof.
To further lower emissions, consider a zero-emission vehicle powered by
electricity or hydrogen. Plug-in electric cars are charged overnight at home
or at a public or workplace charging station. Hydrogen fuel cell electric
cars are refueled at public hydrogen stations. Both produce no tailpipe
emissions, do not require oil changes, have excellent fuel economy, and
require minimal maintenance.
Note: For more information, visit [FuelEconomy.gov](https://FuelEconomy.gov). Green driving is
promoted by the Office of Transportation and Air Quality and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
Other Dangers
All gas-powered vehicles produce carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide
is a deadly, odorless, gas that is released out of the exhaust pipe of the
vehicle. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include: weariness,
yawning, dizziness, nausea, headache, and/or ringing in the ears. Yo u
can prevent carbon monoxide poisoning by having the exhaust system
checked regularly. Also, leave the window partially open when starting
the engine, while driving the vehicle, or when running the engine while
parked. Never run the engine with your garage door closed.
What a Driver Should Do During an Enforcement
Stop
Acknowledge the officer’s presence by turning on your right turn
signal. Activating your signal lets the officer know that you recognize
their presence. An officer may become alarmed if you fail to recognize
them, and might perceive that you have a reason to avoid yielding or that
you might be impaired.
Move your vehicle to the right shoulder of the road. The officer will
guide you using their patrol vehicle. Do not move onto the center median.
Do not stop in the center median of a freeway or on the opposite side of
a two-lane roadway. This places both the driver and the officer in danger
of being hit by oncoming traffic.
On a freeway, move completely onto the right shoulder, even if you’re
in the carpool/HOV lane. Stop in a well-lit area when possible. Pull
your vehicle as far off the roadway as possible. When it is dark, look for
locations that have more light, such as areas with street or freeway lights,
near restaurants, or service stations.
– 92 –
End your cell phone conversation and turn off your radio. The officer
needs your full attention to communicate with you to complete the
enforcement stop in the least amount of time needed.
Remain inside your vehicle unless otherwise directed by the officer.
Never step out of your vehicle, unless an officer directs you to do so.
During an enforcement stop, the officer’s priorities are your safety, the
safety of your passengers, and the officer’s own personal safety. In most
situations, the safest place for you and your passengers is inside your
vehicle. Exiting your vehicle without first being directed by an officer can
increase the risk of being struck by a passing vehicle and/or increase the
officer’s level of feeling threatened.
Place your hands in clear view, including all passengers’ hands, such
as on the steering wheel, on top of your lap, etc. During an enforcement
stop, an officer’s inability to see the hands of the driver and all occupants
in the vehicle increases the officer’s level of feeling threatened. Most
violent criminal acts against a law enforcement officer occur through the
use of a person’s hands, such as the use of a firearm, sharp object, etc.
If your windows are tinted, it is recommended that you roll down your
windows after you have stopped your vehicle on the right shoulder of the
roadway and before the officer makes contact with you.
HANDLING EMERGENCIES
Mechanical Tips
Skids on Slippery Surfaces
Ice and packed snow on the road can cause your vehicle to skid, especially
if you are driving too fast or going downhill. If you start to skid:
• Ease off the accelerator (gas) pedal.
• Stop braking.
• Turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid.
If you cannot control your vehicle on a slippery surface, try to find
something to stop the skid. Try to get a wheel on dry pavement or on the
shoulder of the road. You may have to edge slowly into a snow bank or
bushes to stop the vehicle.
– 93 –
To prevent skidding on slippery surfaces:
• Drive slowly and stay farther behind the vehicle ahead of you.
• Slow down as you approach curves and intersections.
• Avoid fast turns.
• Avoid quick stops. “Pump” the brakes to slow or stop (do not pump
anti-lock brakes).
• Shift to low gear before going down a steep hill.
• Avoid especially slippery areas, such as ice patches, wet leaves, oil, or
deep puddles.
If the brakes get wet, dry them by lightly pressing the accelerator (gas)
and brake pedals at the same time so that the vehicle drives against the
pressure of the brakes. Perform this light pressing only until the brakes
dry.
Driving Off the Pavement
If your wheels drift off the pavement, grip the steering wheel firmly,
ease your foot off the accelerator (gas) pedal, and brake gently. Check
for traffic behind you, gently steer back onto the pavement. Do not pull
or turn your steering wheel suddenly; this may cause you to drive into
oncoming traffic.
Acceleration Skids
An acceleration skid usually happens when the drive wheels lose traction
on the road surface. To maintain control of a skidding vehicle, do not apply
the brakes. Ease off the accelerator (gas) pedal and straighten the front
wheels as the vehicle begins to straighten itself out.
Locked Wheel Skids
This type of skid is usually caused by braking too hard at a high rate
of speed and locking the wheels. The vehicle will skid no matter which
way the steering wheel is turned. Take your foot off the brake to unlock
the wheels. Then, straighten the front wheels as the vehicle begins to
straighten out. If your vehicle is not equipped with anti-lock brakes and
you enter a locked wheel skid, step on the brake gradually until you are
at a safe speed to continue driving. However, if you press the brake pedal
and it sinks to the floor, quickly pump the brake pedal to build pressure.
As you’re pumping the brakes, down shift your vehicle into a lower gear
or neutral to slow down. Then try using your emergency or parking brake
to stop. Slow the vehicle gradually until you are at a safe speed to continue
driving.
– 94 –
Accel erator Mal functi on
If your accelerator becomes stuck, you should:
\1. Shift to neutral.
\2. Apply the brakes.
\3. Keep your eyes on the road.
\4. Look for an alternate route away from traffic or look for a way out.
\5. Warn other drivers by honking and turning on your emergency lights.
\6. Try to drive the car safely off the road.
\7. Stop and then turn off the ignition. Do not turn off the ignition while
moving.
Steering Wheel Locking Device
Warning: Never turn your vehicle’s ignition to the “lock” position while
it is still in motion; the steering will lock and you will lose control of your
vehicle.
Collisions Are Not Accidents
Causes of Collisions
The most common causes of collisions are:
• Driver distractions.
• Unsafe speed.
• Driving on the wrong side of the road.
• Improper turns.
• Violating the right-of-way rules.
• Violating stop signals and signs.
If you see a vehicle’s hazard lights ahead, slow down. There may be a
collision or other road emergency ahead. Stop and give assistance if asked
by anyone, or pass very carefully.
Avoid driving near collisions, if possible. Those injured will be helped
faster if other vehicles aren’t blocking the road.
Involved in a Collision
If you are involved in a collision:
• Yo u must stop. Someone could be injured and need your help. If you do
not stop, you may be convicted of “hit and run” and could be severely
punished.
• Call 9-1-1 if anyone is hurt.
• Move your vehicle out of the traffic lane if no one is injured or killed.
– 95 –
• Show your DL, vehicle registration card, evidence of financial
responsibility, and current address to the other driver, persons involved,
and peace officer.
• You (or your insurance agent, broker, or legal representative) must make
a written report to the police or California Highway Patrol (CHP) within
24 hours of the collision if someone is killed or injured.
• You (or your insurance agent, broker, or legal representative) must make
a written report to DMV within 10 days.
• If you hit a parked vehicle or other property, leave a note with your
name, phone number, and address in or securely attached to the
vehicle or property you hit. Report the collision to the city police, or in
unincorporated areas, to CHP.
• If your parked car rolls away and hits another vehicle, try to find the
owner and report the incident to authorities as mentioned above.
• If you kill or injure an animal, call the nearest humane society, police,
or CHP. Do not try to move an injured animal or leave an injured animal
to die.
Reporting a Collision
When you have a collision, report it to DMV within 10 days if:
• More than  $1,000 in damage was done to the property of any person.
• Anyone was injured (no matter how slightly) or killed.
Each driver (or the driver’s insurance agent, broker, or legal representative)
must file a report with DMV using the Report of Traffic Accident
Occurring in California (SR 1) form. Go online at [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov)[ ](https://dmv.ca.gov)or call
1-800-777-0133 to ask for the SR 1 form. The CHP or police will not
make this report for you.
You or your representative must make this report whether or not you
caused the collision, even if the collision occurred on private property.
Your driving privilege will be suspended:
• If you do not make this report.
• For up to 4 years, if you did not have proper insurance coverage,
regardless of who was at fault during the collision. During the last 3
years of the suspension, your DL can be returned to you if you provide
a California Insurance Proof Certificate (SR 22/SR 1P) and maintain it
during the 3-year period.
– 96 –
Safety Tips
On the Freeway
According to the CHP, if your vehicle becomes disabled on the freeway:
• Safely pull to the right shoulder.
• If you must exit the vehicle, exit on the right side of your vehicle, away
from traffic.
• Once you arrange for assistance, return to your vehicle, get back into the
vehicle from the right side (away from traffic), and put on your seat belt.
• Stay inside your vehicle with the seat belt on until help arrives.
In certain circumstances (when there is not enough shoulder space or if
there is a guardrail or area to safely stay away from the freeway lanes),
exit your vehicle and stay away from your vehicle. Use your emergency
blinking lights at your discretion according to weather conditions. The
lights may be helpful, but they could also attract drunk drivers. The CHP
Freeway Service Patrol (FSP) provides free emergency roadside services
during commute periods. Call 5-1-1 for FSP information and assistance. If
FSP cannot start your vehicle, it will be towed free of charge to a location
approved by CHP. FSP will also contact additional assistance for you.
CHP will notify an auto club or towing service.
If you get stuck on the freeway because your vehicle stops running, FSP
will:
• Offer you a gallon of gas if you run out.
• “Jump start” your vehicle if the battery is dead.
• Refill your radiator and tape hoses.
• Change a flat tire.
• Report any collision to CHP.
The FSP program will not:
• Tow your vehicle to a private repair service or residence.
• Recommend tow service companies or repair and body shops.
• Tow motorcycles.
• Assist vehicles that have been involved in a collision unless directed
by the CHP.
– 97 –
On Railroad Tracks
If your vehicle stalls or is otherwise disabled while
blocking any part of the train tracks, there is no accident
or injury, and:
• The warning lights are flashing/train is
approaching—immediately exit your vehicle, run in
a 45 degree angle away from the tracks in the direction
that the train is coming, and then dial 9-1-1. You may
only have 20 seconds to escape before the train arrives.
• The warning lights are not flashing/you do not
see a train approaching—exit your vehicle and immediately dial the
Emergency Notification System (ENS) number located on the railroad
crossing posts or metal control box near the tracks. Provide the location,
crossing number (if posted), and the road or highway that intersects the
tracks. Be sure to specify that a vehicle is on the tracks. After you call
ENS, call 9-1-1.
DRIVER READINESS
Vision
You need good vision to drive safely (see the Vision section on page [20](#br32)).
If you cannot see clearly, you cannot judge distances or spot trouble, and
you will not be able to make the best judgments. You also need to see
peripherally or “out of the corner of your eye” to spot vehicles coming up
beside you while your eyes are on the road ahead. Have your eyes checked
annually or biennially.
Hearing
The sound of horns, a siren, or screeching tires can warn you of danger.
Sometimes you can hear a vehicle but cannot see it, especially if it is in
your blind spots.
Even people with good hearing cannot hear well if there is too much
noise. It is against the law to wear a headset or earplugs in both ears while
driving.
Hearing problems can come on so slowly that you do not notice them.
Have your hearing checked periodically. Drivers who are deaf or hard of
hearing can adjust their driver safety habits by relying more on their sense
of sight to compensate for the loss of hearing.

Fatigued or Drowsy Driving
Fatigue or drowsiness can affect your vision and increase reaction time to
hazards. Avoid driving if you are fatigued or drowsy.
The following will not prevent drowsy driving:
• Rolling down the window.
• Drinking/eating caffeine or sugar.
• Turning on or turning up the radio.
• Turning on the air conditioning.
The following will prevent drowsy driving:
• Getting enough sleep before driving, and not driving until rested.
• Driving with a passenger, and switching drivers when you start to feel
drowsy.
• Taking regular rest stops even if you are not tired.
• Calling a ride service or friend to take you to your destination.
Medications
Remember that all medications, prescription or over-the-counter, are
potentially dangerous and can impair your driving. Over-the-counter
medicines that you take for colds and allergies can make you drowsy and
affect your driving ability. If you must take medication before driving,
find out the effects of the medication from your physician or pharmacist.
It is your responsibility to know the effects of the medications you
take.
Before you decide to drive, do not:
• Mix medications, unless directed by your physician.
• Take medications prescribed for someone else.
• Mix alcohol with your medications (prescribed or over-the-counter).
Health and Emotions
Emotions can affect the way you drive. Do not let your emotions interfere
with safe driving. Use your good judgment, common sense, and courtesy
when you drive. Follow the recommended safe driving rules.
Discuss health concerns, such as poor vision, heart problems, diabetes, or
epilepsy with your physician and follow their advice. Notify DMV if you
have a condition that might affect your ability to drive safely.
– 99 –
Conditions Physicians Must Report
Physicians and surgeons are required to report patients at least 14 years
old and older who are diagnosed as having lapses of consciousness,
Alzheimer’s disease, or related disorders (California Health & Safety
Code [CHSC] §103900).
Although not required by law, your physician may report to DMV any other
medical condition that they believe may affect your ability to drive safely.
ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
Alcohol/Drugs and Driving Is Dangerous
Alcohol and/or drugs impair your judgment. Impaired judgment or
good sense affects how you react to sounds and what you see. It is also
dangerous to walk in traffic or ride a bicycle while under the influence
of alcohol or drugs.
Much of what has been said about alcohol also applies to drugs.
California’s drunk driving law is also a drugged driving law. It refers to
“DUI of alcohol and/or drugs.” If an officer suspects that you are under
the influence of drugs, the officer can legally require you to take a blood
or urine test. Drivers who refuse these tests are subject to longer DL
suspensions and revocations.
The use of any drug (the law does not distinguish between prescription,
over-the-counter, or illegal drugs) that impairs your ability to drive safely
is illegal. Check with your physician or pharmacist and read the warning
label if you are not sure that taking the medication will affect your driving.
Here are some facts:
• Most drugs taken for colds, hay fever, allergy, or to calm nerves or
muscles can make a person drowsy.
• Medicines taken together or used with alcohol can be dangerous. Many
drugs have unexpected side effects when taken with alcohol.
• Pep pills, “uppers,” and diet pills can make a driver more alert for a short
time. Later, however, they can cause a person to be nervous, dizzy, and
unable to concentrate. They can also affect the vision.
Any drug that “may cause drowsiness or dizziness” is one you should not
take before driving. Make sure you read the label and know the effects of
any drug you use.
– 100 –
Use or Possession of Alcohol or Cannabis
Products in a Vehicle
The law is very strict about use or possession of alcohol or cannabis
products in a vehicle on or off the highway. It is illegal to drink any
amount of alcohol, or smoke or ingest any cannabis product while driving
or riding as a passenger in a motor vehicle. A container of alcohol carried
inside the vehicle must be full, sealed, and unopened; however, this law
does not apply to nondriving passengers in a bus, taxi, camper, or motor
home. An open container of alcohol must be kept in the trunk of the
vehicle or a place where passengers do not sit. Keeping an open container
of alcohol in the glove compartment is specifically against the law. In
addition, the law prohibits the possession of an open container of cannabis
or cannabis product when operating a motor vehicle.
Drivers Under21 (Possession ofAlcohol)
If you are under 21 years old:
• You may not carry liquor, beer, or wine inside a vehicle unless you are
accompanied by a parent or other person as specified by law and the
container is full, sealed, and unopened.
• If you are caught with an alcoholic beverage in your vehicle, the vehicle
may be impounded for up to 30 days. The court may fine you up to
$ 1,000, and either suspend your driving privilege for 1 year or require
DMV to delay the issuance of your first DL for up to 1 year, if you are
not already licensed.
• Your driving privilege will be revoked for 1 year, if you are convicted
of either driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.01% or
higher or driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and/or drugs.
On the first offense you will be required to complete the educational
portion of a licensed DUI program. A subsequent offense may require
a longer DUI program and you will not have a restricted DL to attend
the DUI program.
Exception: Yo u may carry alcoholic beverages in closed containers
while working for someone with an off-site liquor sales license.
Drivers of All Ages
It is illegal to drive after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol in any
form (including medications such as cough syrup), or taking any drug
(including prescription medications), or using any combination of alcohol
or drugs that impairs your ability to drive.
– 101 –
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) Limits
It is illegal for any person to operate a vehicle with a BAC of:
• 0.08% or higher, if the person is 21 years old or older.
• 0.01% or higher, if the person is under 21 years old.
• 0.01% or higher, at any age if the person is on a DUI probation.
• 0.04% or higher, in any vehicle requiring a CDL—with or without a
CDL issued to the driver.
• 0.04% or higher, when a passenger for hire is in the vehicle at the time
of the offense.
DMV can take an administrative action against your driving privilege
after you are detained or arrested for a DUI. The court may take a separate
action for the same offense. DMV’s action is related only to your driving
privilege. The court’s action may involve a fine, jail time, delay of the DL,
and completion of a DUI program.
When notified of a DUI conviction by the court, DMV will take an
additional action to suspend or revoke your driving privilege.
Similar provisions (California Harbors and Navigation Code) apply
when you operate any vessel, aquaplane, jet skis, water skis, or similar
devices. These convictions are placed on your driving record and will be
used by the court to determine “prior convictions” for motor vehicle DUI
sentencing. These convictions are also used when determining the length
of a suspension or revocation action or the reinstatement requirements,
because of a violation you committed while driving a motor vehicle.
Admin Per Se
When you drive in California, you consent to have your breath, blood or,
under certain circumstances, urine tested if you are arrested for DUI of
alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both.
If arrested, the officer may take your DL, issue you a temporary DL for
30 days, and give you an order of suspension. Yo u may request a DMV
administrative hearing within 10 days. The arresting officer may require
you to submit to either a breath or blood test. You do not have a right to
consult with a lawyer before selecting or completing a test.
If your BAC is 0.08% or higher, the peace officer may arrest you
(CVC §§23152 or 23153). If the officer reasonably believes you are under
the combined influence of alcohol and drugs, and you have already
submitted to a preliminary alcohol screening (PAS) and/or breath test,
you may still be required to submit to a blood or urine test because the
breath test does not detect the presence of drugs.
– 102 –
If you refuse to submit to the required blood and/or urine test(s), your
driving privilege may be suspended because of your refusal. Even if you
change your mind later, your driving privilege may be suspended for both
reasons, although both actions will run concurrently.
Under21—Zero Tolerance forAlcohol Use
If you are under 21 years old, you must submit to a hand-held breath test,
preliminary alcohol screening (PAS), or one of the other chemical tests. If your
BAC measures 0.01% or higher on the PAS, you may be suspended for 1 year.
If your PAS shows a BAC of 0.05%, the officer may require you to submit
to either a breath or blood test.
If a subsequent test reveals a BAC of 0.05% or higher, the officer will
issue you an order of suspension and arrest you for DUI (CVC §23140).
Court DUI Convictions
If you are convicted of DUI of either alcohol and/or drugs or both, and
you have an excessive BAC level, you may be sentenced to serve up to 6
months in jail and pay a fine between  $390–$ 1,000 the first time you are
convicted. Your vehicle may be impounded and is subject to storage fees.
On the first conviction your driving privilege will be suspended for 6 months
and you will be required to complete a DUI program, file a California
Insurance Proof Certificate (SR 22/SR 1P), and pay all fees before your DL
can be reinstated. The length of the program may vary. If your BAC is 0.15%
or higher, and you already have a record of other alcohol-related violations
or you refuse to submit to a chemical test, the court may order you to
complete a 9-month or longer program. If your BAC is 0.20% or higher and
the court refers you to an enhanced DUI treatment program, your DL will
be suspended for 10 months. Yo u could also be required to install an ignition
interlock device (IID) on your vehicle. An IID prevents you from starting
your vehicle if you have any alcohol on your breath. If anyone is injured as
a result of your DUI, the suspension period is 1 year.
In cases involving serious injury or death, you may face civil lawsuits.
All DUI convictions will remain on DMV records for 10 years. The
courts and/or DMV may impose more stringent penalties for subsequent
violations during that period.
A BAC below legal limits does not mean that you are safe to drive. Almost
all drivers show impairment by alcohol at levels lower than the legal limit.
The impairment you exhibit at the time you are stopped may be enough to
convict you of a DUI even without a BAC measurement.

INTENTIONALLY BLANK
Drivers 21 and Older—DUI Programs and
Restricted Driver Licenses
Completion of a DUI program is required for all DUI convictions.
Generally, if you are over 21 years old, enroll in a DUI program, file
a California Insurance Proof Certificate (SR 22/SR 1P), and pay the
restriction and reissue fees, DMV will issue you a restricted DL, unless
you hold a CDL. First DUI convictions are allowed a DL that restricts
you to drive to/from work, during the course of employment, and to/from
a DUI program. However, if you are considered a “traffic” or “public
safety” risk, the court may order DMV to not grant you a restricted DL.
Other actions against you may also prohibit the issuance of a restricted
DL.
Note: Commercial drivers are disqualified for 1 year and cannot obtain
a restricted CDL without downgrading to a noncommercial DL (see the
California Commercial Driver Handbook [DL 650] for more information).
Second and subsequent DUI convictions result in increased penalties,
including a 2-year suspension or a revocation of up to 5 years. After you
complete a prescribed period of your suspension/revocation and either
enroll in, or complete a portion of, a DUI program, you may obtain a
restricted DL to drive anywhere necessary, if you:
• Install an IID on your vehicle.
• Agree not to drive any vehicle without an IID.
• Agree to complete the prescribed DUI program.
• File an SR 22.
• Pay the reissue and restriction fees.
ADDITIONAL DRIVING LAWS/RULES
Things You Must Not Do:
• Do not smoke at any time when a minor is in the vehicle. You can be
fined up to  $100.
• Do not dump or abandon an animal(s) on a highway. This crime is
punishable by a fine of up to $ 1,000, 6 months in jail, or both.
• Do not drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless communications
device to write, send, or read text-based communications.
• Do not wear a headset or earplugs in both ears while driving.
• Do not drive a vehicle so loaded, either with property or people, that you
cannot control it, or see ahead or to the sides of your vehicle.
– 106 –
— It is illegal to drive any vehicle with an unsafe, unsecured load that is
a safety hazard (CVC §24002(a)). Unsecured loads (ladders, buckets,
and loose items in the back of pickup trucks) can cause danger for
other motorists, especially motorcycles, when they fall onto the road.
• Do not carry anything in or on a passenger vehicle which extends beyond
the fenders on the left side or more than 6 inches beyond the fenders
on the right side. Cargo extending more than 4 feet from the back rear
bumper of the vehicle must display a 12-inch red or fluorescent orange
square flag or 2 red lights at night.
• Do not allow a person to ride in the back of a pickup or other truck,
unless the vehicle is equipped with seats and the person uses both the
seat and a safety belt.
• Do not transport animals in the back of a pickup or other truck unless
the animal is properly secured; this prevents the animal from falling,
jumping, or being thrown from the vehicle.
• Do not drive a vehicle equipped with a video monitor, if the monitor
is visible to the driver and displays anything other than vehicle
information, global mapping displays, external media player, or satellite
radio information.
• Do not throw any cigarette, cigar, or other flaming or glowing substance
from your vehicle.
• Do not block your view by putting signs or other objects on the front
windshield or back side windows. Do not hang objects on the mirror.
Windshield/window stickers, etc., are permitted in these locations only:
— A 7-inch square on either the lower corner of the passenger’s side
windshield or lower corner of the rear window.
— A 5-inch square on the lower corner of the driver’s side window.
— The side windows behind the driver.
— A 5-inch square located in the center uppermost portion of the
windshield for an electronic toll payment device.
• Do not block or hinder a funeral procession. Vehicles taking part in a
funeral procession have the right-of-way, and if you interfere, obstruct,
or interrupt the funeral procession, you are subject to a citation (CVC
§2817). A funeral procession is led by a traffic officer. All vehicles
taking part in the procession have windshield markers to identify them
and have their headlights on.
• Do not operate a vehicle that has a visual or electronic product or device
that obscures the reading or recognition of the license plate.
• Do not alter a license plate in any manner.
– 107 –
Things You Must Do:
• You must turn on your headlights 30 minutes after sunset and leave
them on until 30 minutes before sunrise.
• You must dim your lights to low beams within 500 feet of a vehicle
coming toward you or within 300 feet of a vehicle you are following.
ADMINISTRATIVE
Financial Responsibility
The California Compulsory Financial Responsibility Law requires
every driver and every owner of a motor vehicle to maintain financial
responsibility (liability coverage) at all times. There are 4 forms of
financial responsibility:
• A motor vehicle liability insurance policy.
• A deposit of  $35,000 with DM V.
• A surety bond for $ 35,000 obtained from a company licensed to do
business in California.
• A DMV-issued self-insurance certificate.
You must possess evidence of financial responsibility whenever you drive,
and show it to a peace officer after a traffic stop or collision when asked
to do so. You may have to pay a fine or have your vehicle impounded if
you do not comply with this law.
Insurance Requirements
The law states that you must be financially responsible for your actions
whenever you drive and for all the motor vehicles you own. Most
drivers choose to have a liability insurance policy as proof of financial
responsibility. If you have a collision not covered by your insurance, or
you do not have insurance, your DL will be suspended. If the driver is
not identified, the owner of the motor vehicle involved in a collision will
have their DL suspended.
The minimum amount your insurance\* must cover per collision is:
•  $15,000 for a single death or injury.
• $ 30,000 for death or injury to more than one person.
•  $5,000 for property damage.
* Low cost automobile policies are available in Alameda, Contra Costa, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and
Stanislaus counties. Contact your insurance agent.
– 108 –
Call 1-800-927-HELP before you purchase insurance to confirm that your
agent/broker and insurer are licensed by the California Department of
Insurance.
If you are visiting California or have just moved here, be aware that not
all out-of-state insurance companies are authorized to do business in
California. Before you drive here, ask your insurance company if you are
covered in case of a collision. If you have a collision in California, all 3
of the following conditions must be met to avoid the suspension of your
driving privilege:
\1. Your liability policy must provide bodily injury and property damage
coverage which equals or exceeds the required limits stated in this
section.
\2. Your insurance company must file a power of attorney allowing DMV
to act as its agent for legal service in California.
\3. You must insure the vehicle before you come to California. You cannot
renew the out-of-state policy once the vehicle is registered in California.
Collisions on Your Record
DMV retains information on every collision reported to DMV by:
• Law enforcement, unless the reporting officer states another person
was at fault.
• You or another party involved in the collision, if any one person has over
$ 1,000 in damage, or if anyone is injured or dies.
It does not matter who caused the collision; DMV must keep this record.
Collisions, Insurance, and Minors
If you are under 18 years old, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must sign your
DL application and assume financial responsibility for your driving. When
you reach age 18, your parent(s) or guardian(s)’ liability automatically
ends.
If you are involved in a collision, your parent(s) or guardian(s) may be
liable for civil damages and you may also be fined.
Exception: Your parent(s) or guardian(s) can have your DL cancelled at
any time while you are a minor.
– 109 –
Getting a Ticket
If you are stopped by a peace officer and cited for a traffic law violation,
you sign a promise to appear in traffic court. When you go to court, you
may plead guilty or not guilty, or you may forfeit (pay) the citation fine.
Paying the fine is the same as a guilty plea.
If you ignore the traffic ticket and do not keep your promise to appear
in court, the failure to appear (FTA) goes on your driver record. Even a
single FTA can cause DMV to suspend your DL. To end the suspension,
you must clear all FTAs with the court, and pay a DL reissue fee of  $55.
Legislation effective June 27, 2017, no longer allows courts to notify DMV
if you fail to pay a fine (FTP). Failing to pay a fine will no longer result
in the suspension of your DL. To get more information, visit the DMV
website at [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov).
Each time you are convicted of a moving traffic law violation, the court
notifies DMV and the conviction is placed on your DL record. Convictions
reported by other states are also added to your driver record.
Evading a Peace Officer
Any person, while operating a motor vehicle, who willfully flees or
attempts to evade a peace officer performing their duties is guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more
than 1 year (CVC §2800.1).
If a person is convicted of causing serious bodily injury during the course
of a police pursuit (CVC §2800.3(a)), they are subject to:
• Imprisonment in a state prison for 3, 5, or 7 years or in a county jail for
not more than 1 year.
• A fine that is not less than $ 2,000 or more than  $10,000.
• Both a fine and imprisonment.
When a person is convicted of manslaughter resulting from evading police
during a pursuit, they are subject to imprisonment in a state prison for a
minimum of 4 to 10 years (CVC §2800.3(b)).
– 110 –
Points on the Driver Record
Your traffic convictions and collisions stay on your record for 36 months,
or longer, depending on the type of conviction.
The Negligent Operator Treatment System (NOTS) is based on negligent
operator points and consists of a computer-generated series of warning
letters and progressive sanctions against the driving privilege.
You may be considered a negligent operator when your driving record
shows one of the following “point count” totals:
• 4 points in 12 months.
• 6 points in 24 months.
• 8 points in 36 months.
Note: The point count may vary for commercial drivers. For detailed
point count information, refer to the California Commercial Driver
Handbook (DL 650).
Traffic Violator School Convictions
When a noncommercial driver is cited for a 1 point traffic violation, the
judge may offer the driver the opportunity to attend a traffic violator
school once in any 18-month period to have the citation masked from
their driving record. Completion of the course is reported electronically
to the court by the school; however, the student will receive a completion
receipt from the school.
Note: When a commercial driver is cited in a noncommercial vehicle, the
driver may be eligible to attend traffic school. Refer to DMV’s website for
further information at [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov).
Suspension or Revocation
If you get too many negligent driver points, DMV will place you on
probation for 1 year (which includes a 6-month suspension) or revoke
your driving privilege (refer to the topics included in the “Administrative”
section on pages [108](#br120)–[114](#br126)). Your suspension or revocation order
informs you of your right to a hearing.
At the end of the suspension or revocation period, you may apply for a
new DL and must show proof of financial responsibility.
DMV will revoke your DL if you are convicted of a hit-and-run or reckless
driving that resulted in injury.
Note: Courts have the authority to suspend a person’s DL.
– 111 –
Record Confidentiality
Most information in your DL record is available to the public. Your
residence address may only be viewed by authorized agencies. Your
mailing address, if different from your residence, is less restricted.
Records on the physical or mental condition of a driver remain confidential.
You may obtain a copy of your driving record at any DMV field office
for a fee with valid ID.
Vandalism/Graffiti—All Ages
California law allows the courts to suspend the DL for up to 2 years of a
person convicted of engaging in vandalism, including graffiti. If you are
convicted and do not have a DL, the courts can delay the issuance of your
DL for up to 3 years from the date you are legally eligible to drive.
Speed Contests/Reckless Driving
A person convicted of driving recklessly or engaging in a speed contest
which causes bodily injury to another person is subject to:
• Imprisonment.
• A fine.
• Both a fine and imprisonment (CVC §23104(a)).
Possessing Firearms
The court will:
• Suspend or revoke the driving privilege of any minor convicted of
possessing a concealable weapon or live ammunition.
• Impose DL sanctions for minors convicted of misdemeanors involving
firearms.
Vehicle Registration Requirements
The following is a brief summary of California’s vehicle registration
requirements. To obtain detailed information, visit [dmv.ca.gov](https://dmv.ca.gov).
California Vehicles
When you purchase a new or used vehicle from a licensed California
dealer, the dealer collects use tax fees to register and title the vehicle.
The use tax is forwarded to California Department of Tax and Fee
Administration (CDTFA).
– 112 –
The transfer and registration fees and documents are submitted to DM V,
which gives you temporary operating authority. Usually within 6 to 8
weeks after the purchase date, you will receive a registration card, license
plates, stickers, and a California Certificate of Title, as appropriate.
If the dealer participates in the Business Partner Automation (BPA)
program, the dealer or their registration service will process DMV
documents and issue the registration card, license plates, and stickers to
the customer.
If you obtain or purchase a vehicle from a private party, you must transfer
the ownership within 10 days. Submit the following to DMV:
• A properly endorsed and completed California Certificate of Title or
Application for Duplicate or Paperless Title (REG 227) form.
• Smog certification, if required.
• Use tax payment, if required.
• Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form (REG 262), if
applicable.
• Appropriate vehicle registration fees.
When you sell or transfer a vehicle, report it to DMV within 5 days.
You can complete the Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability
(REG 138) form online, download and mail the completed form, or call
DMV at 1-800-777-0133 to request the form be mailed.
Out-of-State Vehicles
Vehicles registered in another state or foreign country must be registered
in California within 20 days after you become a resident or get a job
(refer to pag[e](#br15)[ ](#br15)[3](#br15)[ ](#br15)[f](#br15)or information regarding additional residency criteria).
Note: If you are a California resident and acquire a new vehicle, truck,
or motorcycle (this includes certain diesel-powered vehicles) from another
state, ensure that it meets California smog laws; otherwise, it might not
qualify to be registered here. DMV cannot accept an application to
register the vehicle in California when the vehicle does not qualify for
registration (CHSC §§43150–43156).
Nonresident military personnel and their spouses may operate their
vehicles in California with their valid home state license plates or until
the plates issued from the state of their last assigned duty station expire.
They may renew the registration in their home state before it expires or
register the vehicle in California.
– 113 –
The items needed to register any out-of-state vehicle are:
• Completed and signed Application for Title or Registration (REG 343) form.
• Verification of the vehicle completed by DM V, law enforcement agent,
or an auto club employee.
• Out-of-state title and/or last issued out-of-state registration card, if the
title is not submitted.
• Smog certification, if required.
• Weight certificate for commercial vehicles only.
• Appropriate vehicle registration fees and use tax, if applicable.
• Completed Odometer Mileage Disclosure Statement, if applicable.
If the vehicle is purchased from a dealer enrolled in the BPA program, the
documentation may be submitted by the dealer to DM V.
Vehicle Theft Prevention Tips
Here are some tips you can use to help avoid becoming the victim of
vehicle theft.
• Never leave:
— Your vehicle running and unattended, even to dash into a store.
— The keys in the ignition.
— Keys inside a locked garage or a hide-a-key box.
— Valuables, such as purses, laptops, etc., in plain view, even if your
vehicle is locked. Place them out of sight.
— Personal ID documents, such as the vehicle title or credit cards in
the vehicle.
• Always:
— Roll up your windows and lock your vehicle even if it is parked in
front of your house.
— Park in high-traffic, well-lit areas whenever possible.
— Immediately report a stolen vehicle to local law enforcement.
• Suggestions:
— Install a mechanical device that locks the steering wheel, column,
or brakes.
— Think about purchasing a vehicle theft tracking/security system,
especially if you own one of the frequently-stolen model vehicles.
— When you must leave your key with a valet, attendant, or mechanic,
only leave the ignition key.
— Copy your license plate and vehicle information on a card, and keep
that information with you and not in the car. The police will need
this information if your vehicle is stolen.
