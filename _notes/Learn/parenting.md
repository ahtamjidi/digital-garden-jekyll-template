- [Worst Age to Start Daycare: 3 Risks of Starting Too Early](https://www.focusonyourchild.com/worst-age-to-start-daycare-3-risks-of-starting-too-early/) "An article from the Journal of Early Child Development and Care links entry into long hours of non-parental childcare before the first birthday with an increased incidence of poor social behavior, behavioral problems and aggression. When familial influences were considered however, maternal sensitivity was still the biggest indicator of behavioral outcomes in children and offsets the potential negative effects of early childcare."
- [What is the Best and Worst Age for Daycare? Parent's Helpful Guide - Parents Plus Kids](https://parentspluskids.com/blog/worst-and-best-age-for-daycare) "The American Academy of Pediatrics focuses less on when a child should start daycare and more on making sure that the spot chosen for the child is a [high-quality daycare](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/140/2/e20171488.full.pdf). The AAP provides a [quality checklist](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/healthy-child-care/Pages/Choosing-Child-Care.aspx) that parents can choose when looking for daycare situations. One issue is that there have been studies that show infants in daycare are more likely to suffer from [preventable diseases](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20153356), which may make a mother want to rethink her plans. On the other hand, the AAP also states that daycare may be a [safer option](https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/11/11/daycare-centers-safer-infants-pediatrics) for infants than a nanny."
