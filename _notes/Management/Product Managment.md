Today is my last day as a PM at [Facebook](https://www.linkedin.com/company/facebook/)/[Meta](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meta/)!  
  
I'm so grateful for the experience, especially the opportunity to work with + learn from some of the best PMs in the world.  
  
I wanted to collect the top things I learned and share them here. Hopefully, these are helpful to current and aspiring product managers.  
  
(I've included links if you want to go deeper into a concept).  
  
1/ 𝐀𝐬𝐤 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦, 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 💪  
  
Giving low-skill tasks to high-skilled teammates is a waste of their talents.  
  
Engage their full skillset by creating challenges in line with their skill level.  
  
This lets the team have more impact and increases your own leverage.

2/ 𝐋𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐛𝐮𝐫𝐧 🔥  
  
PMs need to be comfortable with persistent fires. You can't solve everything.  
  
Instead, find higher-leverage ways of tackling more than one problem at a time.  
  
Here's how [Brian Chesky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADMIswBYg8PMvGHjU-D4ToY6UdB3J7Mf3k) does it: [https://lnkd.in/drMqGTHK](https://lnkd.in/drMqGTHK)  
  
3/ 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐭𝐡 📜  
  
When you first join a team, write a "State of the Union".  
  
This lets you:  
1/ create context for your team  
2/ show that you understand the team's problems  
3/ build credibility  
  
Here's a template I used after my first 30 days: [https://lnkd.in/dmjKn4ai](https://lnkd.in/dmjKn4ai)  
  
4/ 𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐥𝐲 🎯  
  
Imagine starting a 30-day diet and cheating mid-way.   
  
At the end of 30 days, do you know if the diet/strategy was successful? No.  
  
Key idea: you can only learn, debug or evaluate strategies if they are executed well.   
  
How to do this: [https://lnkd.in/dFRgp4Te](https://lnkd.in/dFRgp4Te)  
  
5/ 𝐀𝐥𝐰𝐚𝐲𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚 ✅  
  
This lets you show your thought process and remain objective.

6/ 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐞 🔎  
  
PM seniority is tied to the size, ambiguity and impact of your scope.  
  
Great PMs create meaningful scope for their teams. You can do this by:  
1/ building capacity  
2/ finding new areas  
3/ capturing with a plan  
  
Here's how to do this: [https://lnkd.in/dEr-zsHF](https://lnkd.in/dEr-zsHF)  
  
7/ 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐚-𝐄𝐱𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐞 👏  
  
Often, it’s in the best interest of teams for the PM to step back from execution to:   
- define long-term plans  
- make sure we’re working on the right things  
  
To do this, PMs need to meta-execute.  
  
This is a big idea, I unpack it here: [https://lnkd.in/e7dFfzgA](https://lnkd.in/e7dFfzgA)  
  
8/ 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐲 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝 🛣  
  
If you're worried they'll choose the wrong things, the lead hasn't given them:  
1/ the right context  
2/ the right prioritization framework  
3/ an ownership culture
