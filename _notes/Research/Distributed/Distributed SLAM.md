"Their key insight was that the sparse QR or Cholesky
factorization that lies at the heart of batch solvers like
Levenberg-Marquardt or Gauss-Newton is equivalent to
converting the factor graph into a Bayes net via an elimination algorithm. The resulting Bayes net can be further
converted into a new data structure coined the Bayes tree
[16] by discovering the cliques in the Bayes net. This
tree structure allows particularly easy and efficient incremental updates and inference. That is, new factors can be
added and a new updated estimate X
âˆ—
is calculated where
only the necessary parts of the tree are re-evaluated."
